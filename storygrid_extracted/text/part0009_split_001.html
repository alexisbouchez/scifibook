<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">GENRE IS NOT A FOUR-LETTER WORD</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen we hear a book or movie described as “Genre,” the speaker is usually denigrating the Story. The designation connotes cheesy slasher films, lame mysteries, Ed Wood-esque science fiction, and bargain-bin romances.</p>
<p class="noindent">When all of the above can be categorized as one of a particular kind of Genre, Genre is not limited to pulp fiction.</p>
<p class="noindent">Genre’s an incredibly broad way of cataloguing all Stories. Like the category Coffee includes all varieties from Sumatra to Folgers, Genre includes <em class="calibre7">War and Peace</em> as well as the pedestrian (to some people) entertainments described above.</p>
<p class="noindent">Genre choices are the most important decisions you need to make.</p>
<p class="noindent">Those choices will tell the reader what they are in for if they pick up your book. They will direct all efforts from your publisher from the front cover art to the publicity tour. If you are not writing in “Genre,” you’re lost. Every Story ever told has Genre classifications.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre7">The Corrections</em> is a Realistic, Long form, Mini-plot, Society, Domestic Drama.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre7">Moby Dick</em> is a Realistic, Long form, Arch-plot, Action, Adventure, Monster Drama.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre7">The Iliad</em> is a Fantastic, Long form, Arch-plot, War/Education, Literary Story.</p>
<p class="noindent">Deciding what Genre(s) your Story will inhabit will also tell you exactly what you need to do to satisfy your potential audience’s expectations. Genre will tell you the crucial conventions and obligatory scenes you must have in your novel. Knowing Genre is the single best way to avoid doing a helluva lot of work for naught. If you don’t know you are writing a horror novel and you spend four months working on a character’s past history for an epic flashback, you’re <a id="page_46" class="calibre4"></a>wasting your time. Better to know up front what Genre best fits the idea or theme you want to convey to your audience before setting off on the work, no?</p>
<p class="noindent">Most importantly, if you fail to abide by your Genre’s requirements, you will not write a Story that works.</p>
<p class="noindent">The only way to write a Story that works is to know exactly what Genre(s) you are exploring and deliver exactly what is required from those Genres. You must know what your reader is expecting before you can possibly satisfy her. And yes, if you are writing a Story, you must think of your audience. A Story means nothing if it is not experienced. If you do the work exceptionally well, you do that thing that we all dream of, you’ll overdeliver on audience expectations. You won’t just satisfy them, you’ll shock and invigorate them. And the reader will have an experience that she will never forget.</p>
<p class="noindent">The first questions we need to ask ourselves are, “What are the Genres of our Story?” and, “What will we have to do to meet those Genres’ expectations?”</p>
