<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">GENRES HAVE CONVENTIONS</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f I hand you my novel and tell you it’s a murder mystery, what would you expect from the book before you even turned the title page?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> You’d expect a dead body.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> You’d expect that an investigator—a police officer, an amateur sleuth, a PI, a cat—will set out to solve the crime.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> You’d expect certain stock characters to appear throughout the novel. The “Watson” to the novel’s Sherlock Holmes or the “prime suspect” for example.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> You’d expect false clues in the plot otherwise known as “red herrings.”</p>
<p class="noindent1">These are a few of the conventions of the mystery Genre. They are elements in the Story that must be there or the reader will be confused, unsettled or so bored out of their skull that no matter how beautiful the sentences, they’ll quit reading.</p>
<p class="noindent">Conventions are not obligatory scenes, which I’ll cover in the next chapter. Rather they are specific requirements in terms of the Story’s cast or methods in moving the plot forward (minor revelatory turning points that must be there but can be weaved into the Story at the writer’s discretion). For example, the Gothic mystery would require the convention of being set in or around an ancient castle circa nineteenth or late eighteenth century. The mystery Genre evolves as new writers try out new kinds of conventions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agatha Christie took a tried and true convention (her brilliant sleuth like Hercule Poirot) and freshened it up when she created the amateur sleuth Miss Marple. But you’ll notice that Christie did not eliminate the central clue-hunter from <a id="page_48" class="calibre4"></a>her Story. She just changed the personality and background of the investigator. She abided by the convention, but innovated its execution.</p>
<p class="noindent">To go back to the joke analogy as emblematic of Story, a convention in a “knock-knock” joke would be having the punch line revealed as a play on words.</p>
<p class="indent">Knock-Knock</p>
<p class="indent">Who’s There?</p>
<p class="indent">Banana</p>
<p class="indent">Banana Who?</p>
<p class="indent">Knock-Knock</p>
<p class="indent">Who’s There?</p>
<p class="indent">Banana</p>
<p class="indent">Banana Who?</p>
<p class="indent">Knock-Knock</p>
<p class="indent">Who’s There?</p>
<p class="indent">Orange</p>
<p class="indent">Orange Who?</p>
<p class="indent">Orange you glad I didn’t say Banana?</p>
<p class="noindent1">The convention of the knock-knock joke is satisfied with punch line word play. It can change from Banana to Orange or from Boo to Boo Who? Doesn’t matter as long as there is word play.</p>
<p class="indent">Knock-Knock</p>
<p class="indent">Who’s There?</p>
<p class="indent">Boo Boo Who?</p>
<p class="indent">Don’t cry… it’s just a Knock-Knock joke.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_49" class="calibre4"></a>But the “Knock-Knock” and “Who’s there?” elements of the joke are obligatory. They have to be there literally. In their exact form. These obligatory elements are so familiar and identifiable to the listener/reader that they immediately induce an expectation. Once we hear “Knock-Knock,” we expect the convention of the joke form…a fun play on words payoff. If we don’t get the play on words convention, the listener won’t laugh. The joke will die. It doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, to not give the listener the actual “Knock-Knock” and “Who’s there?” obligatory elements for the joke is ridiculous right? The punch lines, <em class="calibre7">Orange you glad I didn’t say Banana</em> or <em class="calibre7">Don’t cry…it’s just a Knock-Knock joke,</em> mean nothing without the obligatory setup of Knock-Knock and Who’s there.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whenever you start mulling whether or not to include a convention or obligatory scene in your Story, think of the “Knock-Knock” joke and what it would be like without a play on words punch line or “Who’s there?”</p>
