<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t long last, now it’s time to combine the Macro with the Micro and create <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The first thing we need to do is to get out a big piece of graph paper.</p>
<p class="noindent">I use eleven-inch by seventeen-inch paper that is divided into .25 inch boxes, which will give you sixty-eight boxes from left to right and forty-four boxes from bottom to top. You can also use a spreadsheet program like Excel. Just set it up so that the row and column settings are both at .25 inches.</p>
<p class="noindent">I turn it so that it is in the horizontal configuration and then count up twenty-two boxes from the bottom which will be just about the middle of the page and draw a thick black line across. This will be the horizontal, or x-axis of our <em class="calibre7">Story Grid</em> for <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs</em>.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the horizontal x-axis we will use one box to designate a scene from <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs</em>. From our <em class="calibre7">Story Grid Spreadsheet</em>, we know that there are sixty-four total scenes in the book, so I label from one to sixty-four across the black line from left to right.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under and above each of the scene numbers, I’ll boil down each scene event that I’ve written on my <em class="calibre7">Story Grid Spreadsheet</em> to the shortest possible phrase or sentence that tells me what’s happened. I’ll then write down the event above or below the horizontal line to designate the value shift of that particular scene.</p>
<p class="noindent">So if the scene moves from a positive to a negative value charge, I will put the label for that scene beneath the x-axis to indicate that it ends negative. If the scene moves from a negative to a positive charge, I will put the label for that scene above the x-axis to indicate that it ends positive.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_292" class="calibre4"></a>What do I glean from the <em class="calibre7">Foolscap Global Story Grid?</em> The Beginning Hook, Middle Build and Ending Payoff of the Global Story. So I’ll move to scene 12 on my sheet and draw a vertical line straight down from top to bottom and I’ll do the same at scene 50. Now I have the whole novel broken down into the three component parts.</p>
