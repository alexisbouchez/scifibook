<p class="noindent">What started out as a hubris-laden declaration, <em class="calibre7">I’ll just toss off some thoughts and we’ll bang out a paperback</em>, for Steven Pressfield and my little publishing company soon turned into a monster.</p>
<p class="noindent">Over the three years it took to write, <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> became nothing less than the sum total of my life’s professional work. To get that kind of stuff out of your frontal lobe requires a lot of help.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without Steven Pressfield, I’d still be sulking in front of a computer screen with miles to go before I slept.</p>
<p class="noindent">Steve and I have worked together for almost twenty years. On this project, we reversed roles. Steve took on the editor role and I took on the writer assignment. It could have been a disaster. But Steve was the nicest noodge ever. He never pressured me and I have no doubt he would not have damned me even if I’d never gotten this book onto paper. And that was a real possibility. His editorial notes were incisive and kind. They made a meandering mess of stuff cohere.</p>
<p class="noindent">We’ve won some and we’ve lost some. But it’s always been fun. Even in our darkest publishing hours, we’ve always found something to laugh about. Thanks, Pard!</p>
<p class="noindent">My wife Bibb and my kids Bleecker, Waverly and Crosby had to hear hour after hour of blather about this book for far too long. They never made me feel bad about it. Instead they listened and helped me immeasurably to simplify things that could easily have ended up obtuse and didactic.</p>
<p class="noindent">Callie Oettinger, the brains behind Black Irish Books, coordinates all of the production, sales and publicity for our titles. And she does it with a commitment and purpose that inspires.</p>
<p class="noindent">Jeffrey Simon is our dear friend who makes video production, design and technology something that two old dogs can actually understand.</p>
<p class="noindent">Derick Tsai at Magnus Rex is an absolute pleasure to work with. A designer par excellence with the tact of Norman Vincent Peale, Derick created all of the art for <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> and got me through a major meltdown at the finish line.</p>
<p class="noindent">Our copyeditor Amanda Brown is a Godsend.</p>
<p class="noindent">Seth Godin gave me the subtitle. Thanks, Seth!</p>
