<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">THE AUTODIDACT’S DILEMMA</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">F</span>aced with the reality that the editors with whom I was apprenticing (very respected, very talented, and very generous) did not have the time or the textbooks necessary to teach me how to Edit, I set out to teach myself. The primary dilemma we face with a task that is foreign to us is “<em class="calibre7">where do I begin?</em>”</p>
<p class="noindent">Where you begin is a personal choice and as long as it pushes you to dive deeper into or zoom out from a particular discipline, it matters little if you start at the sentence-by-sentence editorial level or the global Big Picture elevation. As someone with a science background, I like to begin at the top of the mountain (a grand hypothesis) and chip my way down to sea level (a series of experiments to test the hypothesis) and eventually into the basements and subbasements (the tactical approach to setting up the experiments themselves).</p>
<p class="noindent">Knowing that editing was dependent upon understanding Story, the first question I asked myself was:</p>
<p class="noindent">“What is the primary divide in the long form Story business?”</p>
<p class="noindent">If you were to create a flow chart of how book publishing works with a box at the top that says STORY IN BOOK FORM, what would be directly underneath? How many secondary classifications would there be?</p>
<p class="noindent">This turned out to be a simple question to answer.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are two categories in book publishing, like yin and yang, light and dark, wet and dry. There is “literary” and “commercial.” The divide seems ridiculous of course, akin to the old chicken and egg debate. Obviously, what is literary must be commercial too and what is commercial is also literary. But these two global designations define the two cultures of book publishing. As a practical matter, it’s crucial to understand exactly what each is and why there is a distinction in the first place.</p>
