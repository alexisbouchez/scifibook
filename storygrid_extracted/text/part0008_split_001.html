<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">WHAT I DO</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen a person meets me for the first time and learns that I make my living as a literary editor, the first question he invariably asks is:</p>
<p class="noindent">“What exactly is it that you do?”</p>
<p class="noindent">This book is the long answer.</p>
<p class="noindent">The short answer is this:</p>
<p class="noindent">When a manuscript that intrigues me arrives, I read it. I don’t take notes. I just read it. If I finish the entire book— twenty-four times out of twenty-five, I’ll abandon it early on as the obvious work of an amateur—I will start to think seriously about its publishability. Does it work? Will it sell?</p>
<p class="noindent">My editorial juices have started flowing now. Already I’m beginning to analyze and break down the manuscript’s narrative. My decades of experience are telling me where, more or less, the Story is working and where it’s not.</p>
<p class="noindent">So far my process is identical to that of every other professional editor. But now, at this stage, I’ll do something that no one else does.</p>
<p class="noindent">I will run the manuscript through <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em>.</p>
<p class="noindent">I’ll do this as deeply as necessary and as many times as required to identify the problems, to evolve suggested solutions, to hone the Story and shape it and elevate it to the highest level of Storytelling craft.</p>
<p class="noindent">Over a twenty-five-year career as an editor and independent publisher (as well as a writer, agent and manager) I’ve used this method to bring hundreds of works from raw manuscripts into A-level published fiction and nonfiction. Books that I have edited and published have grossed more than one hundred million dollars. But more importantly, these books have changed people. They’ve changed the lives of readers and they’ve revolutionized the lives of the writers who authored them.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_12" class="calibre4"></a><em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> is a tool. It’s a technique. It can’t make something out of nothing, but it can make something out of almost-something, out of not-quite-something, out of two-inches-away-from-something.</p>
<p class="noindent">And it can inspire a work from idea to first draft.</p>
<p class="noindent">What <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> offers is a way for you, the writer, to evaluate whether or not your Story is working at the level of a publishable professional. If it is, <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> will make it even better. If it isn’t, <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> will show you where and why it isn’t working—and how to fix what’s broken.</p>
<p class="noindent">What follows is how you can become your own editor.</p>
