<h2 class="chap-title1" id="calibre_pb_22"><strong class="calibre8">THE REALPOLITIK OF BOOK PUBLISHING</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen a Story “works,” it makes you want to keep listening to it, or reading it or watching it. And what will happen next, while completely in keeping with its initial promise (a Western, a Bildungsroman, a ghost Story around a campfire, whatever), delights over and over again. But the kicker is that the climax will be utterly refreshing. By Story’s end, the listener or reader or watcher has to be at the very least surprised and satisfied by the payoff of the Story’s initial promise.</p>
<p class="noindent">And sometimes, rarely unfortunately, the ending can bring an emotional catharsis large enough to change the way we see our world and even make us change our behavior because of it.</p>
<p class="noindent">This from David Mamet’s <em class="calibre7">Bambi vs. Godzilla</em> on what makes a Story work. “They start with a simple premise and proceed logically, and inevitably, toward a conclusion both surprising and inevitable.”<sup class="calibre14"><a id="fn1" class="calibre4"></a><a href="part0018.html#ifn1" class="calibre4">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent">A Story has the exact same structure as a joke. When someone tells us a joke, the Genre (“knock-knock,” “a horse walks into a bar,” “take my wife”) sets us up for an expectation. When the payoff is inevitable, but surprising, “orange you glad I didn’t say banana,” “Why the long face,” “PLEASE”), we laugh.</p>
<p class="noindent">Later on in the book, I will ask you to outline the major scenes in your long form Story (<em class="calibre7">The Foolscap Method</em>). Now, if you wish to know if your Story will “work” before you bang out a hundred-thousand-word manuscript, or revise a hundred-thousand-word manuscript, I suggest you take someone out to dinner (someone you trust who won’t tell you what you want to hear, but won’t undermine you either) and tell them the fifteen crucial movements from your Foolscap Page.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_36" class="calibre4"></a>In Hollywood, this is called a “pitch.”</p>
<p class="noindent">You will know if your Story works if the person across the table actually pays attention. If your Beginning Hook doesn’t grab him, you’ll know it in a microsecond just by his expression. If your Middle Build doesn’t raise the tension and make him desperate to know what they hell is going to happen, you’ll know. And obviously, if your Ending Payoff is flat, he’ll be trying to get the waiter’s attention to get the check.</p>
<p class="noindent">But if your Story works, he will beg you to write it for others. In Hollywood, that’s called “buying it in the meeting” and it is nothing short of Nirvana. To speak for twenty minutes and to walk out of a meeting with the promise of tens of millions of dollars, if not hundreds of millions, committed to putting the stuff inside your head into the global marketplace must be both exhilarating and terrifying.</p>
<p class="noindent">But the screenwriter knows that if he delivers what he pitched, he’ll be fine. Even if the movie never gets made…</p>
<p class="noindent">Is it possible to bring both great line-by-line and cathartic Story work to a project? Can there be an innovative literary novel that is also a barnburner of a read? Or a potboiler that is exquisitely written? Such is the Holy Grail of publishing.</p>
<p class="noindent">And of course, the answer is a resounding “YES.”</p>
<p class="noindent">When line-by-line and global Story magic come together, our jaws drop. It’s why we pick up any book, hoping that this one will join the short list of those that have changed our lives.</p>
<p class="noindent">I will run you through <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> of such a novel at the end of this book, Thomas Harris’ <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs.</em> You’ll see the sixty-four pieces of his puzzle and how he was able to put them together in perfect order, all the while staying truer than true to Story form. And he ended up innovating the conventions and obligatory scenes of his chosen Genres too.</p>
<p class="noindent">And guess what? You can run any novel (or narrative nonfiction) through <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> and see the same kinds of pieces and choices.</p>
<p class="noindent">But back to the state of editing in today’s book-publishing landscape.</p>
<p class="noindent">Can you expect that the book you’ve written, which was good enough to attract an agent and also good enough to be acquired by a publishing house, will be raised to a higher level by your new editor? Remember, editors are paid by the publisher.</p>
<p class="noindent">The primary job of the Big Five publishing editor and/or independent publisher hanging on by his financial fingernails is to concern himself with whether or not <a id="page_37" class="calibre4"></a>the book works commercially. That is, will the book excite and satisfy a critical mass of readers who will fork over their hard-earned cash to experience the Story? Will they come back for the author’s next book too? Will the Story in its present form make money?</p>
<p class="noindent">If the answer to that question is yes, the Big Five or independent publisher will invariably deem it ready to go. However, if the editor at the Big Five house or independent publisher suspects that the core audience for the book may reject it based upon the fact that the critical conventions and obligatory scenes in the book (more on this later) are not surprising enough, he’ll put the writer through the editorial process. He’ll make the writer re-write the clunkers and get them to a place where he believes the Story will satisfy its core audience.</p>
<p class="noindent">The truth of the matter is that today there are so many Stories vying for the validation of major publishing that Big Five editors don’t even acquire books that have clunker obligatory scenes or conventions anymore. The editor passes on them because there are enough books coming in to him that are ready to go. Why waste time fixing something when you’ve got plenty of things on offer that already work?</p>
<p class="noindent">Remember that the Big Five or Independent publishing editor’s first job is <strong class="calibre5">not</strong> to bring a Story to its creative epitome. It’s to make the damn thing good enough to sell.</p>
<p class="noindent">In my career I’ve seen the number of full-time editorial positions and full-functioning publishing companies cut in half, while the number of titles published and imprints started has at least doubled. Do the math on how much time an editor today can indulge his desire to understand Story. So give your editor some slack and remember that the first rule for him is DO NO HARM!</p>
<p class="noindent">If he thinks your book can sell ten thousand copies as is (the usual place that will send a book into profitability, and they would not have offered you a contract if they didn’t think it would sell ten thousand) he isn’t going to ask you to re-write the act 2 climax. He may not even know what that is. If he did ask you to do that work, and you do, and your book sells 9,999 copies, it’s going to be his fault.</p>
<p class="noindent">And even if the book sells 12,500 after you’ve fixed the scene, who do you think will get the credit? The editor? Not so much. In fact, there will probably be a bunch of reviews about the book asking, <em class="calibre7">Where was the editor?</em> You’ll forget about his contribution and think that the marketing team hit it out of the park.</p>
<p class="noindent">So will everyone else. Even him. Trust me.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is the realpolitik of book publishing and it’s one you need to understand.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is why you need to become your own editor.</p>
