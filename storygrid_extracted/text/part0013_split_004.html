<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">TRACKING CONTINUITY</strong></h2>
<h3 class="h2">Point of View, Period/Time, Duration, Location Onstage Characters, Offstage Characters</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he last six columns in <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid Spreadsheet</em> concern Story continuity.</p>
<p class="noindent">These are important to track so that you keep all of the setting, time, and character entrances and exits in sync. On the screen, continuity glitches can take the viewer right out of the experience. We’ve all seen movies where a character is smoking a long cigarette in one scene. And then the shot cuts to another character and then back to the cigarette smoker who is now holding a drink with no cigarette in sight. Those continuity glitches aren’t just distracting; they ruin the viewer’s ability to suspend their disbelief. The same thing can happen in a novel or play.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre7">The Story Grid Spreadsheet</em> is the place to keep track of all of the little details that can sabotage the finest of stories.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, this is pure analytical labor. It takes serious concentration. So, I’d suggest doing only a limited amount of this work per day. Set a goal to do ten scenes and then shut it down and walk the dog. You can get seriously hinky if you try and knock off these details in a day. Take your time. The more accurate the spreadsheet is, the more helpful it will be.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here are the column headings with brief descriptions:</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong class="calibre5">Point of View</strong> is the vantage point from which the reader/ viewer sees the fictional world. You’ll see that Thomas Harris uses nine different points of view in <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs</em>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong class="calibre5">Here is a chart of all nine along with the number of scenes each has in the novel.</strong></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_233" class="calibre4"></a><img src="../images/00010.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_234" class="calibre4"></a>Where Harris chose to switch points of view were critical decisions. The way you choose to approach point of view is no less crucial. Track them and you’ll be able to experiment. If you don’t track them, you won’t know how you handled this crucial Storytelling device from scene to scene. And that is just silly not to know.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong class="calibre5">Period/Time</strong> is simply the time of day, hour, weekday, month or year that the scene is taking place. For example, late afternoon, Thursday February 6 is a very specific period and time designation. The more specific you are with the period and time in each of your scenes, the better. If you are unable to pinpoint exactly when the scene you’ve written has taken place, you need to figure that out. If you don’t know, the reader certainly won’t either.</p>
<p class="noindent">Why would you ever want to lose a reader because they are confused about the time in a scene? Thomas Harris embedded all of the information necessary to map out the exact time and day of his Story. I figured it out. You have to be able to do it too.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong class="calibre5">Duration</strong> describes the approximate length of time the scene took to occur. If it’s a meeting, chances are it won’t last longer than fifteen minutes. If it’s a long chase action scene, the duration could be much longer. You need to choose how long your scene will play out. Again, specificity and variety are keys to holding a reader’s interest. One meeting scene after another will bore them to tears. And action scene, action scene, action scene will suck the life out of them.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong class="calibre5">Location</strong> is literally where the scene is taking place. Again be as specific as possible.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong class="calibre5">Onstage Characters</strong> column is a literal list of all of the characters present in the scene. It’s important to have a keen understanding of who is on stage in every single scene. If someone never appears on stage and is just referred to, that choice will have a very big impact on how the reader imagines them. I also track the total number of players on stage and place the number next to the list in a separate column. Again we don’t want the same characters over and over again in the same combinations. We want variety.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong class="calibre5">Offstage Characters</strong> are the people who are not in the scene but are referred to by the people on stage. This is especially important when tracking “speeches in praise of villains” in thrillers and in establishing relationships between characters. If your onstage characters never refer to any offstage characters, the scene will not feel authentic. The first thing we all do in a conversation is refer to other people. If your characters don’t do that in your Story, they will not come off as “real.” I also track the total number of players mentioned off stage in the scene and place the number next to the list.</p>
