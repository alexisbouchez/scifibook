<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">THE MATH</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">C</span>reating a <em class="calibre7">Foolscap Global Story Grid</em> for a complete work is all well and good, but then what?</p>
<p class="noindent">How do you begin to actually map out the rest? How long will it take you to write the first draft? Is there a way to take the “Beginning Hook, Middle Build, and Ending Payoff” concepts even further to break down the work into more “doable” parts?</p>
<p class="noindent">This is where a little rudimentary math will help.</p>
<p class="noindent">But before we dive into it, remember that <span class="nounder">you</span> are not the problem. The problem is the problem. And the problem we’re facing now is figuring out how to map out a course to get from idea to first draft or how to evaluate the first draft we have in hand. At the beginning of the long form Story process, the problems we face are innumerable. To demystify exactly how a lump sum of words can be broken down into component parts is extraordinarily helpful. If we can cut our problems into bite size pieces that we can contend with one by one, one day, one session at a time, then we can beat Resistance into submission and finish our first draft or edit our first draft.</p>
<p class="noindent">I know. You hate math. That is why you became a writer/ Storyteller. But, math is a Godsend. And a very cursory look at the math of a novel is definitely worth the time.</p>
<p class="noindent">Why?</p>
<p class="noindent">Math helps you break problems into little bits. It’s much easier to figure out where to cut a piece of lumber than it is framing a house. Your mind can’t really wrap itself around framing a house. But if you break the work down into its component parts, you’ll reach a very doable level of skill…a skill that is relatively easy to master. Measuring the length of a board, marking where to cut it, and then taking a saw and ripping it at that mark is the primal skill for a carpenter.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_143" class="calibre4"></a>If you can do that one skill well (and you can screw it up very easily too) you are well on your way to learning how to frame a house.</p>
<p class="noindent">Same goes with writing or editing a long form Story.</p>
<p class="noindent">So let’s look a novel in mathematical terms.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here are some facts.</p>
<p class="noindent">The average length of a commercial novel today is between eighty thousand and one hundred thousand words. Are there exceptions? Sure, but this ballpark range is where the novel has settled over the last twenty years or so. It’s the length the average reader is expecting—not too much and not too little. So, it’s a safe assumption to make that if you want to begin a path that will satisfy a particular readership, your goal is to put together eighty thousand to one hundred thousand words in a unique and compelling way.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s break it down further using the Foolscap method.</p>
<p class="noindent">To keep it simple, you’ll need a beginning, middle, and an end to your Story. No matter how many acts you have (three to five to seven), you need a beginning to your Story, a middle section to your Story and an ending to your Story. As an editor, I don’t worry so much about figuring out exactly how many acts are in a book. For me, the Beginning, Middle and End are all that matter. The beginning may comprise two acts, the middle three acts and the end two acts, but I don’t really care. Instead I concentrate on the five building materials for each of the three sections. I think about the Inciting Incident scenes, Progressive Complications scenes, the Crisis scenes, the Climax scenes and the Resolution scenes for the beginning, middle and end of a book. (Don’t worry; I’ll go over these crucial elements of Story form in much greater detail in <a href="part0011_split_000.html" class="calibre4">part 4</a>.)</p>
<p class="noindent">As you’ll recall, the key building block for a long form narrative is the scene. Beats are the actor’s domain. Scenes are the writer’s. (I’ll review the building blocks of Story in <a href="part0012_split_000.html" class="calibre4">part 5</a>.)</p>
<p class="noindent">So the first breakdown of the eighty-thousand to one-hundred-thousand-word book are the scenes necessary to create the five building materials for your beginning, middle and end of your Global Story. So there will be at least fifteen scenes in your book:</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">1.</span> You’ll need a scene that is the Inciting Incident of the beginning of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">2.</span> You’ll need a scene that is the Inciting Incident of the middle of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><a id="page_144" class="calibre4"></a><span class="num">3.</span> You’ll need a scene that is the Inciting Incident of the end of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">4.</span> You’ll need a scene that progressively complicates the beginning of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">5.</span> You’ll need a scene that progressively complicates the middle of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">6.</span> You’ll need a scene that progressively complicates the end of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">7.</span> You’ll need a scene that creates a crisis question at the beginning of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">8.</span> You’ll need a scene that creates a crisis question in the middle of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">9.</span> You’ll need a scene that creates a crisis question at the end of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">10.</span> You’ll need a scene that climaxes the beginning of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">11.</span> You’ll need a scene that climaxes the middle of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">12.</span> You’ll need a scene that climaxes the end of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">13</span> You’ll need a scene that resolves the beginning of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">14.</span> You’ll need a scene that resolves the middle of your Story.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">15.</span> You’ll need a scene that resolves the end of your Story.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But how long should they be? How many words should each scene be? And then how many words should be in the beginning? How many words should be in the middle? How many words should be in the end?</p>
<p class="noindent">Here is a piece of information that professional writers spend ten thousand hours of their lives figuring out. After thousands of years of Storytelling, the beginning, the middle and the end for a long form Arch-plot or Mini-plot Story breaks down as follows:</p>
<p class="noindenti">The Beginning is about one quarter of the Story.</p>
<p class="noindenti">The Middle is about one half of the Story.</p>
<p class="noindenti">The End is the last quarter of the Story.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_145" class="calibre4"></a>Are there stories that do not break down 25/50/25? Absolutely. But if you were to average every Story ever told, 25/50/25 would be the result. I have a theory about why Stories break down like this. That’s up next.</p>
<p class="noindent">So, if you are writing a one-hundred-thousand-word novel, the beginning will generally be twenty-five thousand words, the middle will generally be fifty thousand words and the end will be the last twenty-five thousand words. We’ve already determined that we need at least fifteen scenes in the book, five in the beginning, five in the middle, and five in the end.</p>
<p class="noindent">What about the rest?</p>
<p class="noindent">Nerds like me have noticed that typically, in contemporary commercial fiction, scenes run between one thousand and five thousand words. Remember that a scene creates a clear value change in the life of a character through conflict. When I break down <strong class="calibre5"><em class="calibre7">The Story Grid for The Silence of the Lambs</em></strong>, you’ll see where Thomas Harris fell on the scene word count spectrum. My personal recommendation is to take a page from the master and keep your scenes, like Harris’, around two thousand words. I also recommend that you treat your scenes like chapters. That is, each scene should be a chapter in your novel.</p>
<p class="noindent">Why?</p>
<p class="noindent">Two-thousand-word scenes/chapters are potato chip length.</p>
<p class="noindent">That is, if you are about to go to bed and you’re reading a terrific novel and the scenes/chapters come in around two-thousand-word bites, you’ll tell yourself that you’ll read just one more chapter. But if the narrative is really moving after you finish one of these bites, you won’t be able to help yourself reading another. If the Story is extremely well told, you’ll just keep eating the potato chip scenes all through the night.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whereas, if you cram five scenes into a chapter that ends up being forty pages, the bedside reader will have a much easier time just setting the book down before beginning the long slog through seventy-five hundred words.</p>
<p class="noindent">People like to stop reading when they’ve finished a chapter, not in the middle of a chapter. This is probably the last thing they’ll tell you at the Iowa Writer’s Workshop, but it’s a reality worth considering.</p>
<p class="noindent">You can accomplish quite a bit in two thousand words, and if you successfully leave out the stuff that the reader does not need explained to them, two thousand words can often be way too much.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_146" class="calibre4"></a>Anyway, let’s assume that all of the scenes/chapters in our novel are two thousand words long. So if we’re writing a one-hundred-thousand-word novel, we’ll have about fifty scenes/chapters in our novel. From our earlier beginning, middle and end discussion, we know that fifteen of those fifty scenes are already spoken for. So we’ll need to write thirty-five more.</p>
<p class="noindent">I know. You are an artist and this mathematical manipulation is probably rubbing you the wrong way. I get it. But remember, the math is just a way to break down an extremely intimidating task into doable units.</p>
<p class="noindent">So we have thirty-five scenes left. Let’s set aside 25% of these for the BEGINNING, 50% of them for the MIDDLE and the other 25% for the END.</p>
<p class="noindent">So we’ll need seven to eight scenes in addition to our five obligatory scenes for our beginning (twelve to thirteen total).</p>
<p class="noindent">We’ll have twenty additional scenes to play with in addition to our five obligatory scenes in the middle (twenty-five total).</p>
<p class="noindent">And we’ll have seven to eight scenes in addition to our five obligatory scenes for our end (twelve to thirteen total).</p>
<p class="noindent">Take a look at <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> now based on this information. You can now see the entire form of your novel without having written a single word. You’ve got doable pieces of work that can be attacked one day, one session at a time.</p>
<p class="noindent">But let me emphasize again that you may end up with six scenes for the beginning, thirty for the middle and fourteen for the end or the other way around. There is no “rule” about 12/25/13. We are merely trying to map out a course of work for us to bang out a first draft. After we have a first draft, we can go back and analyze exactly which scenes work and which scenes don’t work. But if we never write a first draft because we get stuck after writing three scenes, we’re never going to finish the novel. Better to have a map of the targets we need to hit in order to make it to the end. Once we get there, then we can fix our blunders.</p>
