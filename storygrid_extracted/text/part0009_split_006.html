<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">CHOOSING YOUR GENRES</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou probably have a general idea of the kind of Story you’ve already written or the one you want to write. You know it in generic terms. Now is the time to reconsider and clearly define your choices. Doing so will ground your work so that when you get stuck, you can always go back to these choices and evaluate whether you’ve abided their conventions and/or obligatory scenes.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the first leaf of our Five-Leaf Genre Clover are the TIME GENRES, which are usually self-evident. You want to write a novel or a short Story or a screenplay for a short film. Any one of them is valid. Any one is easy to label. The same Story and <em class="calibre7">Story Grid</em> principles abide for all of the time Genres.</p>
<p class="noindent">Chances are you’ve picked from the REALITY and STYLE leaves too without thinking too much about them. And that’s fine. Micromanaging the choices you make in Time, Reality and Style can result in paralysis by analysis. Remember, <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> and everything it entails is a tool. It is not an end in itself. So to obsess about whether your Story is a drama with comedic elements or a comedy with dramatic elements is time best spent elsewhere. <em class="calibre7">Terms of Endearment,</em> the novel and the film, use both comedy and drama in the telling. You can too with your Story. But when push comes to shove, I think we’d all agree that <em class="calibre7">Terms of Endearment</em> is globally a drama. It concerns itself with real emotional truth. Whereas, the global comedy, <em class="calibre7">There’s Something about Mary</em> relentlessly avoids emotional truth.</p>
<p class="noindent">It’s important though to clearly write down exactly what choices you’ve made. Doing so will allow you to go back later on and make sure that you consistently abided by the conventions of those choices.</p>
<p class="noindent">For the nature of the REALITY leaf, if your lead character is anthropomorphized, you’re definitely working in the fantasy arena. If it’s a novel based on a historical event, you’re in the FACTUALISM arena.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_63" class="calibre4"></a>Again, what’s important is to write all of the choices down.</p>
<p class="noindent">I’ll suggest a one-page <em class="calibre7">Foolscap Global Story Grid,</em> a phrase I’ve borrowed from Steven Pressfield and his mentor Norm Stahl, later on that you’ll use as a lifeline to track your global Story. It will be the thirty-thousand-foot view that will put you back up in the sky and settle your nerves when you inevitably panic and think you’ve crashed your Story. You’ll use the <em class="calibre7">Foolscap Global Story Grid a</em>long with <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid Spreadsheet (</em>which tracks the micro movements in your Story) to create your final <em class="calibre7">Story Grid</em> infographic.</p>
<p class="noindent">Now with the first three leaves of our Five-Leaf Genre Clover considered (<strong class="calibre5">TIME</strong>, <strong class="calibre5">REALITY</strong> and <strong class="calibre5">STYLE</strong>), we’re ready to detail the complementary relationship between the fourth leaf—<strong class="calibre5">STRUCTURE</strong>—and the fifth leaf—<strong class="calibre5">CONTENT</strong>.</p>
