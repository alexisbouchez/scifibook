<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">GENRE’S <em class="calibre10">FIVE-LEAF CLOVER</em></strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>enre is the one of the most difficult foundations of Story to wrap your mind around. There are so many theories and categorizations of Genre, the editor/Story student can easily fall into an intellectual whirlpool. I’ve been sucked in so many times by so many different ways to look at Genres that my head spins thinking about it.</p>
<p class="noindent">I’m so susceptible to Genre inside baseball that I even named my literary agency Genre Management Inc. to remind myself of its importance.</p>
<p class="noindent">Not surprisingly, where I finally come out on Genre serves the purposes of my method of editing a Story. My goal is and always has been to take comprehensive theory and make it practical. So I started my deep dive into Genre with a few core goals.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> What combination of Genre theories can best serve the writer adrift at his desk?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> How can the conventions of a particular Genre be codified and written down as a list of must-have obligatory scenes or conventional characteristics?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> How can we use those conventions and obligatory scenes inherent in Genres to best effect?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> How can we make practical use (taking an idea and extrapolating a “doable” and “testable” task) of the deep thinking about Genre in order to best evaluate our work?</p>
<p class="noindent1">So my exploration of Genre is purely practical.</p>
<p class="noindent">What follows is a combination plate of theories from many different sources from Aristotle and Plato, to Goethe, Georges Polti, Norman Friedman, Will Wright and others.</p>
<p class="noindent">But the biggest influence on my thinking is Robert McKee, bestselling author of <em class="calibre7">Story: Style, Structure, Substance and the Principles of Screenwriting</em>, and his colleague Bassim El-Wakil. When McKee and El-Wakil release their own book on Genre, I will, without hesitation, recommend that you read <a id="page_56" class="calibre4"></a>and digest everything they have to say about it. But until we get their masterwork, here is a crash course from my experience to get you started.</p>
<p class="noindent">The most ingenious ideas that McKee and El-Wakil put forth revolve around the interplay of their five distinct categories of Genre, which I will explain shortly. But before I do, just to keep us on track, here is a working definition of Genre so that we know exactly what we’re breaking down:</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong class="calibre5">A Genre is a label that tells the reader/audience what to expect. Genres simply manage audience expectations.</strong> It’s really that simple. Don’t let the French etymology and pronunciation scare you.</p>
<p class="noindent">We all know what to expect from a mystery novel, a love Story, or an action movie. These categories tell us what we’re in for when we pick up a book or go to the movies or the theater. But what are those buried specific expectations that must be satisfied before a Story lands with us? What do we expect to know about a Story before we’ll even consider listening or reading or watching it? As per McKee and El-Wakil, there are five primary expectations of the audience.</p>
<p class="number1"><span class="num">1.</span> We expect to know how long the Story will last.</p>
<p class="number1"><span class="num">2.</span> We expect to know how far we’ll need to suspend our disbelief.</p>
<p class="number1"><span class="num">3.</span> We expect to know the style, the particular experience of the Story.</p>
<p class="number1"><span class="num">4.</span> We expect to know how the Story will be structured.</p>
<p class="number1"><span class="num">5.</span> We expect to know what the general content of the Story will be.</p>
<p class="noindent1">With these five questions in mind, McKee and El-Wakil sorted the myriad of familiar Genres we all know intuitively into five major categories.</p>
<p class="noindent">I find it helpful to think visually and with most of the blood flowing through my veins being of Irish origin (the book publishing company I co-founded with Steven Pressfield is called Black Irish Books) I think of the five categories as leaves on a five-leaf clover. Each of the five leaves nourishes the central locus of the clover, the Global Story.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to manage the most primal of reader/audience expectations, writers must make at least five clear choices, at least one from each leaf. And more often than not, with secondary and tertiary subplots, they’ll use more than one from a particular offshoot. But more on those choices later.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here is how I define McKee and El-Wakil’s five big categories, our leaves on the five-leaf clover that answer each of the questions above.</p>
<p class="number1"><span class="num">1.</span> <strong class="calibre5">TIME GENRES</strong> answer how long the Story will be.</p>
<p class="number1"><span class="num">2.</span> <strong class="calibre5">REALITY GENRES</strong> answer how far the audience will have to suspend their disbelief.</p>
<p class="number1"><a id="page_57" class="calibre4"></a><span class="num">3.</span> <strong class="calibre5">STYLE GENRES</strong> answer how we’ll experience the Story.</p>
<p class="number1"><span class="num">4.</span> <strong class="calibre5">STRUCTURE GENRES</strong> answer how broad or minimalist or nontraditional the global telling of the Story will be.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The last leaf, the <strong class="calibre5">CONTENT GENRES</strong>, are the ones everyone thinks of when they think of Genre. I further divide CONTENT into two sub categories, which I call the EXTERNAL and the INTERNAL. More on why I do this later on.</p>
<p class="number1"><span class="num">5.</span> <strong class="calibre5">CONTENT GENRES</strong> answer the theme/controlling idea of the Story.</p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alpha_float">a.</span> EXTERNAL CONTENT GENRES determine the conscious object of desire for the protagonist(s). More on objects of desire later on.</p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alpha_float">b.</span> INTERNAL CONTENT GENRES determine the subconscious object of desire for the protagonist(s).</p>
<p class="noindent1">And here are specific choices a writer has at his disposal for each of the big categories. This list is by no means exhaustive, but it’s comprehensive for our purposes.</p>
<p class="number2"><span class="bull">1.</span> <strong class="calibre5">TIME GENRES</strong></p>
<p class="alpha1"><span class="alpha_float">A.</span> Short Form—short films, short stories, or individual scenes in a play.</p>

<p class="alpha1"><span class="alpha_float">A.</span> Factualism—stories that refer to facts of history or biography. They refer to part of the historical record implying “This Story Did Happen,” like the movie <em class="calibre7">Argo</em> or <em class="calibre7">12 Years a Slave</em> or <em class="calibre7">Serpico</em>.</p>
<p class="alpha1"><span class="alpha_float">B.</span> Realism—stories that could happen in real life, but are imagined, <em class="calibre7">Law and Order</em>, the crime novels of Ian Rankin, etc.</p>
<p class="alpha1"><span class="alpha_float">C.</span> Absurdism—stories that are not remotely real, like Eugene Ionesco’s play <em class="calibre7">The Bald Soprano</em> or <em class="calibre7">Looney Tunes</em></p>
<p class="alpha1"><span class="alpha_float">D.</span> Fantasy—stories of wonder and imagination that require a comprehensive suspension of disbelief, the type of which is delineated by three Subgenres.</p>
<p class="numbers"><span class="num">1.</span> Human—anthropomorphized reality like George Orwell’s novel <em class="calibre7">Animal Farm</em> or fantastical experience like the movie <em class="calibre7">Groundhog Day</em> that can be set in one of two time periods.</p>
