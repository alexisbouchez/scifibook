<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">THE FIVE COMMANDMENTS OF STORYTELLING</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t’s now time to review the timeless principles that we rely upon to create and evaluate the building blocks of a long form Story—scenes. Scenes build into sequences, which build into acts, which create our Beginning Hooks, Middle Builds and Ending Payoffs.</p>
<p class="noindent">The five elements that build Story are the Inciting Incident (either causal or coincidental), progressive complications expressed through active or revelatory turning points, a crisis question that requires a choice between at least two negative alternatives or at least two irreconcilable goods, the climax choice and the resolution.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here they are in outline form:</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">1.</span> Inciting Incident</p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alpha_float">a.</span> Causal</p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alpha_float">b.</span> Coincidence</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">2.</span> Progressive Complication</p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alpha_float">a.</span> Active Turning Point</p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alpha_float">b.</span> Revelatory Turning Point</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">3.</span> Crisis</p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alpha_float">a.</span> The Best Bad choice</p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alpha_float">b.</span> Irreconcilable goods</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">4.</span> Climax</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">5.</span> Resolution</p>
<p class="noindent1">These five elements must be clearly defined and executed for each unit of Story. I’ll go into further detail about all of the units of Story later on, but for now it’s important to note:</p>
<p class="number"><a id="page_158" class="calibre4"></a><span class="num">1.</span> Every <strong class="calibre5">beat</strong> has an Inciting Incident, progressive complication(s), a crisis, a climax and a resolution.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">2.</span> A well-designed series of beats builds to the next unit of Story, the <strong class="calibre5">scene</strong>, which also has an Inciting Incident, progressive complications, a crisis, a climax and a resolution.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">3.</span> Scenes build into <strong class="calibre5">sequences</strong>, which also have Inciting Incidents, progressive complications, crises, climaxes and resolutions.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">4.</span> In turn sequences build into <strong class="calibre5">acts</strong>, which have their own Inciting Incidents, progressive complications, crises, climaxes and resolutions.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">5.</span> <strong class="calibre5">Subplots</strong> also have Inciting Incidents, progressive complications, crises, climaxes and resolutions, and can be tracked in exactly the same way as the global Story. They act more like add-on extensions or outbuildings to the property that make the global Story a deeper and more satisfying experience.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">6.</span> And lastly, <strong class="calibre5">the global Story</strong> itself has its own Inciting Incident, progressive complications, crisis, climax and resolution.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Like an organic structure, a Story has a base set of internal materials that integrally combine to form self-contained units of mini-Story, which in turn combine to form even more complex systems. Ultimately, all of the systems combine to create a work of intellectual property.</p>
<p class="noindent">Just as cells form tissues, which interact to form organs that work with other organs to form systems (skeletal, nervous, circulatory etc.) with ultimately fourteen systems making up the anatomy of a human being, so do beats combine to form scenes which combine to form sequences which combine to form acts and subplots and ultimately the Beginning Hook, Middle Build and Ending Payoff of a global Story.</p>
<p class="noindent">But without the engines of creation (the Inciting Incident, progressive complications, crisis, climax and resolution) beats, scenes, sequences, acts, subplots and the global Story will have no life. It is never a bad idea to revisit these crucial Story elements before we begin a new project or just after we’ve banged out our first draft of a project…just before we put on the editor’s hat.</p>
<p class="noindent">Knowing them and trusting their efficacy are mandatory. A writer who does not pound these concepts into her head will never come close to reaching her artistic <a id="page_159" class="calibre4"></a>potential. There is no escaping them. And anyone who tells you differently is either ignorant or a charlatan. Seriously.</p>
<p class="noindent">So my advice is to surrender to them. Bow down to them. Hold them closely to your heart. They will save you from yourself. They will outwit and out duel any bullshit you or anyone else will come up with to get you to ignore them so that you can write “freely.” Sure go nuts on your first draft and riff all you want. But when you dive into your edit, you’ve got to make sure that these five elements are present in every beat, scene, sequence, act, subplot and global Story.</p>
<p class="noindent">When Moses’ cousin, Morrie the writer, went up the mountain seeking a cure for his writer’s block, God didn’t have time to give him all of the answers. And wouldn’t you know it, Morrie climbed up unprepared. He only had a crumpled coffee shop napkin and a leaky pen in his shirt pocket. So God did Morrie a solid and boiled Story down to just five commandments.</p>
