<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">THE FINAL TWEAKS</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">S</span>o, we’ve tracked the entire scene-to-scene movement of <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs</em> in terms of its external and internal values. And we’ve identified quite a number of places within its scenes where Thomas Harris has abided by the conventions and obligatory scenes of his chosen global Story—the serial killer thriller. We’ve also tracked the exact places where the Beginning Hook has transitioned into the Middle Build and where the Middle Build has transitioned into the Ending Payoff.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s now load all of that information into <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> so that at a glance, we’ll be able to remind ourselves where Harris did what. The real value of <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> is in its immediate gratification. That is, in the years prior to creating <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> infographic, every time I had a question like “<em class="calibre7">When did Thomas Harris drop in his clock?</em>” I had to go look at a pile of notes.</p>
<p class="noindent">And I’d have to dig through it until I found the answer. I don’t know about you, but once I found that answer I’d often forget the original question I was trying to answer!</p>
<p class="noindent">But now with <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em>, all I have to do is look for the clock moment on the grid. Then I’ll know it was in scene 19 (<a href="part0009_split_006.html#ch17" class="calibre4">chapter 17</a>), six scenes into the Middle Build. Similarly, when you map out your own <em class="calibre7">Story Grid</em> for your work in progress, you may see that you’ve jammed a whole bunch of stuff into one series of scenes, or your values are not dynamically moving in the way that they should. Seeing it visually as opposed to trying to piece it together in your brain intellectually will be extremely useful.</p>
<p class="noindent">So our final <em class="calibre7">Story Grid</em> for <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs</em> with all of the crucial conventions and obligatory scenes marked as well as the BH, MB, and EP demarcations follows.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_328" class="calibre4"></a><img src="../images/00031.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/><a id="page_329" class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_330" class="calibre4"></a>But <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> on the cover of the book and on the poster of <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs Story Grid</em> doesn’t have all this information. What’s up with that?</p>
<p class="noindent">We stripped down the exhaustive information of the writer’s version of <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> to its essence for the infographic version for a simple reason. There’s just too much INSIDE BASEBALL in the crazy detailed one. Whittling down the details, we came to the conclusion that the most important visual takeaway for <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> is the movement of the external (the red line on the cover) and internal (the blue line of the cover) content values.
