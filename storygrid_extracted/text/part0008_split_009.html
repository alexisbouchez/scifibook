<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">KNOWING THE RULES SO YOU CAN BREAK THEM</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here is a reason why I first divided long form Story into business terms. A very good reason, and believe it or not, it has more to do with Art than Commerce.</p>
<p class="noindent">Every writer wants to be read. And the best way to learn whether your Story is reaching people is to tally the number of them willing to part with their hard-earned cash to experience your work. Understanding exactly how and why certain kinds of Stories find an audience much faster than others allows an artist to make informed choices. Long form Story creation requires years of devotion. Knowing the general sense of how many people will want to read your Story before you set off to do the work will help manage your expectations.</p>
<p class="noindent">That is, wouldn’t it be better knowing up front that your novel about the conquest of an adolescent by a pedophile will in all likelihood fail to reach a wide readership no matter its packaging?</p>
<p class="noindent">The Professional writer, whether consciously or subconsciously, knows exactly where his idea sits on the Literary and Commercial spectrum long before he starts to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some even take on the challenge to prove a commercial “truth” wrong. They succeed or fail based on their Story Craft. Incredibly inventive line-by-line writing matched with superlative Story form charts new ground, while lackluster line-by-line matched with derivative Story execution fails to do much of anything.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are innumerable reasons why the premise of <em class="calibre7">Lolita</em> (pedophile pursues adolescent and gets his conquest) should alienate an audience, but for the great majority of readers, it doesn’t. Vladimir Nabokov probably didn’t literally say to himself, “I know this book I’m writing will be impossible to actually sell, but I gotta be me. I’m gonna do it anyway.”</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_34" class="calibre4"></a>But I’m confident he did set out to challenge himself in a way no one else would dare. He knew that writing about a taboo subject, not just writing about it, but writing about it from the point of view of the predator, was a ridiculous business decision. It was obvious in his day, and even today I don’t see many who’d be willing to go down that road.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nabokov wasn’t a part of our postmodern, digital age either. There weren’t three hundred thousand books coming out every year vying for the attentions of literary agents, editors and publishers. There was no way to effectively “self-publish.” The marketplace was much smaller then and the business elements far more Draconian. And his chances of getting his novel published pre-e-book pale in comparison to today.</p>
<p class="noindent">But he refused to allow the impossible odds of his book reaching a critical mass of readers to stop him from writing it. Instead he probably used the unlikelihood of <em class="calibre7">Lolita</em> making it to the front table of the equivalent of Barnes and Noble in his day to free his inner darkness. The result was that we got a game-changing novel that proved the irresistible nature of human longing as narrative.</p>
<p class="noindent">To know the rules of the Story Business and of the Story Craft gives you the freedom to break them. Not knowing the rules is a recipe for disaster. Trust me, Nabokov knew the rules of Story and the rules of publishing. That is why he was able to break them so skillfully.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre7">Lolita</em> is a classic “quest/hero’s journey” Story, the one that is so deeply ingrained within our cells that we can’t help but root for even the most despicable protagonist like Humbert Humbert to get what he wants. Nabokov knew that the structure of the Quest Story is irresistible to readers. He knew that with a lot of hard work, he could use it to get people to not just sympathize with a monster like Humbert, he’d get them to even empathize with him. Talk about powerful. The book was so good it was banned.</p>
<p class="noindent">The point is that you should know what you are getting yourself into before you dive in. Nabokov did. That’s why he used the power of Story form to beat the odds.</p>
