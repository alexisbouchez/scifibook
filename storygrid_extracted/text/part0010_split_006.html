<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">POINT OF VIEW</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ext up on our <em class="calibre7">Foolscap Global Story Grid</em> is the space to fill in point of view.</p>
<p class="noindent">Point of view is the vantage point the writer chooses to tell the reader a Story. Your point of view choices will dictate the tenor of each beat, each scene, each sequence, each act and the entire work. They are crucial choices. (I’ll do a follow up chapter to this on Free Indirect Style next for more on how best to approach the literal telling.)</p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say that you have two characters in a scene. Two brothers. The younger brother is the prodigal son. He’s left town years ago and now has decided to come home to the family farm. He’s coming back—not because he’s broke and destitute and in need of help—rather because he’s wealthy beyond whatever he expected out of life. But his material possessions have brought him no happiness. He’s coming home to rekindle his love for his dear brother who stayed behind to take care of the family while he went out to make his fortune.</p>
<p class="noindent">The older brother is the workhorse farmer who has sacrificed his own individual ambitions in order to care for the extended family. The farm survives only by his efforts.</p>
<p class="noindent">How will these two greet each other? What will they want from one another? Will one get what he wants while the other doesn’t? One of the best places to begin to answer these questions (if you haven’t already) is by approaching them through point of view.</p>
<p class="noindent">You’ll have four point of view choices to describe this “coming home” scene. Your choice of global Genre will dictate which choice to make, hence why I’ve spent so much time laying out the Genres. Knowing what point of view will best serve your Genre is the key.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_130" class="calibre4"></a>You could:</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> Place the center of the narrative “inside the mind” of the rich younger brother coming home, and share his thoughts as if there were a magical parrot sitting on his shoulder capable of hearing and repeating the character’s inner world to the reader. (See the Free Indirect Style chapter coming up next.)</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> You could put the parrot on the farmer brother’s shoulder.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> You could alternate between the two brothers’ points of view and their respective magical parrots.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> You could place the narrative center above the world and describe the scene as if you are the child at play with two dolls and a farm set. This reportorial/neutral point of view is the strict third person omniscient voice that does not tell the reader what is going on inside the heads of the characters. Or if it does, it does so from a God-like perspective. (Again, read the upcoming chapter Free Indirect Style for more on this.)</p>
<p class="noindent1">How do you decide?</p>
<p class="noindent">If the younger brother is the protagonist of your Story—your novel could be a modern society/redemption Story about the corrupting powers of ambition—I’d suggest you follow everything that happens from his point of view.</p>
<p class="noindent">If your Story is a western/testing Story about the difficult choice someone might make to safeguard the lives of others at the expense of his own “self-actualization,” I’d suggest you follow everything that happens from the farmer brother’s point of view.</p>
<p class="noindent">If your Story is a domestic drama/sentimental Story about the pressures of shifting from one kind of family dynamic and back again, then perhaps using both points of view would serve your purposes well. In this case, both brothers would serve as protagonists and antagonists, depending upon the particular circumstances of the global family saga Story’s arc. See <em class="calibre7">Giant</em> by Edna Ferber.</p>
<p class="noindent">If your Story is not about either of these brothers, but is a historical drama/punitive Story about a plague and the effects it has on regular people, you’ll probably want to write it as strict third person omniscient with perhaps a smattering of indirect speech to invest the reader emotionally with one or more characters.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_131" class="calibre4"></a>Here’s my advice to get you started. If you are writing a traditional Arch-plot structured novel, write the first draft from the point of view of your protagonist. Either in the first person or by using third person omniscient (all knowing/Godlike) Free Indirect Style.</p>
<p class="noindent">Quick reminder:</p>
<p class="noindenti"><strong class="calibre5">First Person</strong> means the Story is told by the narrator…<em class="calibre7">I saw my brother in the field.</em></p>
<p class="noindenti"><strong class="calibre5">Second Person</strong> means that the Story is told with the narrator referring to the reader as you…<em class="calibre7">You saw him in the field</em>. Rarely do novelists use the Second Person. Jay McInerney did a remarkable job with it in <em class="calibre7">Bright Lights, Big City</em>.</p>
<p class="noindenti"><strong class="calibre5">Third Person </strong> means the Story is told from a narrative distance—<em class="calibre7">Jim Smith saw his brother Luke in the field.</em></p>
<p class="noindent1">If you can sustain interest in the trials and tribulations of that one character and use the inner life of that lead character to best effect, you’ll get the most out of the Arch-plot form. But after you’ve finished the first draft, you may find places in the Story that would benefit from a shift in point of view. That is, you may need to get Story events onto the page that the protagonist is not privy to. Or you’ll want to layer in another character’s thoughts to counterbalance those of your protagonist.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs</em> Thomas Harris makes use of nine points of view. Primarily Clarice Starling (the protagonist), but he also gives at least two chapters/scenes to Buffalo Bill/Jame Gumb (the antagonist), Jack Crawford (the mentor) and Hannibal Lecter (the anti-mentor).</p>
<p class="noindent">Starling is the dominant force of the novel. But if Harris did not stretch out and use the POVs of the other three characters, the reader would have a very generic sense of the forces aligned with her and those against her. Without seeing Buffalo Bill/Jame Gumb prepare to harvest his victim, the novel would lose a great deal of tension. Starling would not be privy to that preparation, so if Harris strictly maintained her POV, we’d lose a very chilling scene.</p>
<p class="noindent">You’ll notice though that Harris does not give us the antagonist’s POV until the Middle Build portion of his novel, nor does he give us Hannibal Lecter’s until even later on in the book. He does give us Jack Crawford’s POV in chapter five. That choice allows the reader to attach to Crawford emotionally. Harris understood that Crawford’s actions up to that point are very stoic and dictatorial, if not Machiavellian. By giving us his world early, the reader can’t help but see <a id="page_132" class="calibre4"></a>that his behavior is a mask. A mask to cover up the horrors of his personal life experience. And thus, the reader allows him his misanthropy. Empathizes with him.</p>
<p class="noindent">You’ll also notice Harris using minor characters’ points of view with Free Indirect Style to ratchet tension in critical moments. He does this so seamlessly that the reader does not mind the POV shifts.</p>
<p class="noindent">Big caution: Too many POV shifts are irritating.</p>
<p class="noindent">Especially in the Beginning Hook of a Story. You need the reader to get attached to your protagonist before you can branch out. Finding the perfect mix is the challenge. The simple rule to follow is…if the POV shift takes the reader out of the global world and confuses them for even a millisecond…don’t do it.</p>
