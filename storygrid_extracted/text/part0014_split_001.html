<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">BACK TO GENRE</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you’re like me, right now your head is swimming.</p>
<p class="noindent">You’ve just spent three or four weeks using a microscope to lay out the elements of a novel, all of its scenes and continuity details, turning points, values etc. Moving from minutiae to the view from thirty thousand feet is a very difficult transition. No matter how many books I’ve worked on, the moment I’ve completed <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid Spreadsheet</em> brings great joy and soon thereafter great sorrow. Because inevitably, I’ll have this really cool document and not really know what to do with it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Don’t panic.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is in these times that Genre will save you. Remember that Genres manage audience expectations. So if we head back to looking at the big picture by detailing the Genres inherent in our Story, we’ll be able to make sure we hit all of our marks. That is, we can make sure that we abided by the conventions and obligatory scenes of our chosen Genres. And once we’ve made sure we’ve done that, we can then hone them so that they are extraordinary. But if we don’t have a checklist of things to make sure we’ve done, we’ll just get lost in the details of our micro <em class="calibre7">Story Grid Spreadsheet</em>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <em class="calibre7">Foolscap Global Story Grid</em> is that checklist. So let’s fill it out and see how Thomas Harris solved all of his Genres requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s go back to those very important half dozen questions that the editor must ask himself of every project that crosses his desk. These are the make or break questions that will give him the definitive answer to that crucial question—Works, Doesn’t Work?</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_258" class="calibre4"></a><img src="../images/00020.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/><a id="page_259" class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_260" class="calibre4"></a>Here they are again:</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">1.</span> What’s the Genre?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">2.</span> What are the conventions and obligatory scenes for that Genre?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">3.</span> What’s the Point of View?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">4.</span> What are the protagonist’s objects of desire?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">5.</span> What’s the controlling idea/theme?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">6.</span> What is the Beginning Hook, the Middle Build, and Ending Payoff?</p>
<p class="noindent1">After we’ve answered these six big questions, we’ll be able to build our <em class="calibre7">Foolscap Global Story Grid</em> one page—the single page document that gives us our Big Picture. So let’s take a deep breath and just start out with answering Genre.</p>
<p class="noindent">After just one read, an experienced Editor would have no problem (with the exception perhaps of the Internal Content Genre) categorizing <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs’</em> Genres.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s run ‘em down:</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">1.</span> <strong class="calibre5">TIME</strong>: Obviously, the novel is long form Storytelling.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">2.</span> <strong class="calibre5">REALITY:</strong> From the first page, with its reportorial sensibility and the specificity of its references to a real life law and order institution (FBI) and settings, it’s clear we’re dealing with the realities of contemporary life. So Realism is the Reality Genre.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">3.</span> <strong class="calibre5">STYLE:</strong> As we are dealing with concrete emotional terrain, the Style Genre is Drama.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">4.</span> <strong class="calibre5">STRUCTURE:</strong> Structure is classic Arch-plot with a protagonist on a personal quest (Ambitious newbie trying to become FBI agent) and then given an external mission too (interview the craziest killer ever).</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">5.</span> <strong class="calibre5">CONTENT:</strong></p>
<p class="alpha"><span class="alpha_float">A.</span> EXTERNAL: The External Content Genre has all of the markings of the thriller (see the earlier chapters, THE UNIVERSAL APPEAL OF THE THRILLER and THE OBLIGATORY SCENES AND CONVENTIONS OF THE THRILLER) and as it concerns the hunt for a serial killer, the flavor of thriller is serial killer.</p>
<p class="alpha"><a id="page_261" class="calibre4"></a><span class="alpha_float">B.</span> INTERNAL: I’ll get into the Internal Content Genre and why I categorize it as “disillusionment” later on.</p>
<p class="noindent">Okay, so we know the Genres. We can now fill in our Foolscap.</p>
