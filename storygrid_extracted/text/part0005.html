<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">FOR RAMEN NOODLE EATERS</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the days, months and years to come, it is my intention to map out <em class="calibre7">Story Grid</em>s for as many novels (and some key nonfiction works) as possible. You can follow my work at <a class="nounder" href="http://www.storygrid.com">www.storygrid.com</a> and get free access to everything I do.</p>
<p class="noindent">No joke. It’s free.</p>
<p class="noindent">Would I prefer that you buy this expensive textbook instead? Pay even more to view or attend lectures? Hire me for an outrageous sum to give you personal tips?</p>
<p class="noindent">Well, sure I would.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, here’s the thing:</p>
<p class="noindent">When I started out, there were very few people in book publishing who shared what they knew. Almost no one would. So I had to learn 99.9% of what I know and what I write about in this book myself. It took me twenty-two years to do that. And three years to write this book.</p>
<p class="noindent">I can only wonder what I would have been able to do if I were given access to this information all those years ago. For Free!</p>
<p class="noindent">I was broke back then. I walked a lot of times to work because I didn’t want to spend the subway fare to get there. And I spent practically every weekend at my desk at the publishing office because where I lived was…dark, dank and depressing. Plus it had no air conditioning in the summer and poor heat in the winter.</p>
<p class="noindent">But I would have done the same thing even if I had lived in the penthouse of Trump Tower.</p>
<p class="noindent">I love what I do and I’m not complaining about my life’s path or work. I just think it would have been incredible if there were something like <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> available to me back then.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_2" class="calibre4"></a>So if you’re that man or woman eating ramen noodles every night and staying every waking hour at the office trying to figure out how to write a great Story or edit a great Story, go to <a class="nounder" href="http://www.storygrid.com">www.storygrid.com</a> and dive into the archives. You’ll get everything you need there. And after you’ve sold your novel or gotten that big job, buy a copy of this book and give it to someone like you were…before you made it big or even just big enough. And continue the conversation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Stories are the most important thing we humans can create.</p>
<p class="noindent">We need more Story nerds! As one to another, I hope you get something out of this book to make your work better.</p>
