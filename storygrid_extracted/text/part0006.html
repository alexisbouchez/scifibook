<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">BECOMING OUR OWN EDITORS</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t was the great Maxwell Perkins, if I’m not mistaken, who told Hemingway to get rid of the first two chapters of <em class="calibre7">The Sun Also Rises</em>. Hemingway did. The book made him famous.</p>
<p class="noindent">Perkins got Thomas Wolfe to cut ninety thousand words from <em class="calibre7">Look Homeward, Angel.</em> He whipped twenty shoeboxes of raw manuscript into <em class="calibre7">Of Time and the River.</em></p>
<p class="noindent">Do you know what an editor does? I don’t either. All I know is it’s make-or-break, do-or-die, indispensable, can’t-do-without, gotta-have-it.</p>
<p class="noindent">But there’s one problem:</p>
<p class="noindent">Editors don’t exist any more, at least not in the grand Old School sense.</p>
<p class="noindent">These days if you’re lucky enough to get your book picked up by a major publisher, you may get taken to lunch by your editor. You may receive a few consultatory e-mails. You may even get a three-page memo of “notes.”</p>
<p class="noindent">But you will not get Maxwell Perkins.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you’re indie-publishing or self-publishing, you’ll get no editor at all.</p>
<p class="noindent">It’s a hard fact of the twenty-first-century book biz that the writer, for all intents and purposes, has to be her own editor.</p>
<p class="noindent">You and I are expected to deliver a Story that works, a manuscript that’s flawless, a book that’s ready for the printer.</p>
<p class="noindent">That’s editing. (Or, more accurately, self-editing.)</p>
<p class="noindent">But what <em class="calibre7">is</em> editing?</p>
<p class="noindent">Is it correcting grammar? Spell-checking? Syntax tweaking?</p>
<p class="noindent">When I was working on my third book, <em class="calibre7">Tides of War</em>, Shawn Coyne was my editor at Doubleday in New York. He read the manuscript (which was almost nine hundred pages <a id="page_4" class="calibre4"></a>long). He studied it. He lived with it. Then he got on a plane and flew out to Los Angeles, where I live. Shawn stayed with me for three days. He worked with me around the clock, explaining what was working in the Story and what wasn’t and why—and, more importantly, showing me what I needed to do to fix it. He left me with a twenty-six-page single-spaced memo. I still have it.</p>
<p class="noindent">It took me four more drafts and nine months before Shawn accepted the manuscript.</p>
<p class="noindent">That’s editing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Over a twenty-five-year career as editor, publisher, agent, manager and writer, Shawn has been part of more than 350 books, 97 of which have become national bestsellers in North America. Books he has edited or published have sold over fifteen million copies. But until I began working with Shawn as a partner in our own small publishing company, I had no idea of the depth of an editor’s contribution.</p>
<p class="noindent">A great editor sees the Story globally and microscopically at the same time. He has x-ray vision. He looks down from thirty thousand feet. A great editor can break down a narrative into themes, concepts, acts, sequences, scenes, lines, beats. A great editor has studied narrative from Homer to Shakespeare to Quentin Tarantino. He can tell you what needs fixing, and he can tell you how to fix it.</p>
<p class="noindent">How many editors of that caliber are working today? I’m guessing now. A dozen? Two? No more.</p>
<p class="noindent">But what about us, the writers? How many novels have we written that are near-brilliant, almost-great, wildly-promising-but-not-quite-fulfilled? What’s missing? What did we get wrong?</p>
<p class="noindent">What’s missing is editing. Story analysis. Concept, character, and narrative breakdown.</p>
<p class="noindent">But how do you learn editing? They don’t teach it at Harvard and they don’t school you at Random House.</p>
<p class="noindent">A great editor has to teach himself. He learns through experience, through manuscript after manuscript and book after book.</p>
<p class="noindent">A great editor develops a system, a philosophy. He distills the arcane and the academic into a working model that’s clear, practical, and usable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Shawn did that.</p>
<p class="noindent">He calls his method <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em>.</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_5" class="calibre4"></a><em class="calibre7">It took me twenty-two years [Shawn writes] to figure out The Story Grid was not something that any other book editor I knew used. After innumerable lunch and drink dates, I found out that they didn’t create their own method to evaluate work by studying Story structure. And they thought I was kind of a nerd for doing that myself.</em></p>
<p class="noindent">The writer is allowed to be crazy. She’s permitted to wing it, to plunge ahead on instinct, to follow her Muse and let her Story rip. But it’s the editor who has to take that Story and make it work.</p>
<p class="noindent">A great editor has to fathom the narrative’s underlying design (of which the artist is often blissfully unaware), and if there is no design, he has to draw one forth from the existing material. He has to chart the Story’s movements, conflicts, themes and counter-themes, its values and the valences of those values. He’s the mechanic. He’s the surgeon. His left brain makes the artist’s right brain work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Who is the editor today?</p>
<p class="noindent">He’s you.</p>
<p class="noindent">You have to master the editor’s skills. You have to know how to break down your own Story, before you begin (hopefully) and after you’re done (if necessary). Art is not enough. Genius is not enough. Editing and Story analysis are not some extra goodies affixed at the end of the banging-out-the-pages work; they are the heart and soul of Storytelling. You, the writer, have to know them.</p>
<p class="noindent">How do you learn?</p>
<p class="noindent">The book in your hand is the place to start.</p>
