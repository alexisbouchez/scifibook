<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">GENRES HAVE OBLIGATORY SCENES</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hile conventions of particular Genres often concern a Story’s cast of characters (the best friend sidekick in a love Story or the monster in a horror Story), setting (the labyrinthine castle setting in a Gothic romance) or method of turning plot (red herrings in a mystery/crime novel), obligatory scenes are the must-have elements to pay off the raised expectations of those conventions. They are the equivalent of the place markers, “knock-knock” and “who’s there?” in a knock-knock joke.</p>
<p class="noindent">Back to our mystery novel:</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> You’d expect a “discovery of the body scene.”</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> You’d expect an eventual confrontation between the investigator and the murderer—what I call the “J’accuse” scene.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> You’d expect an ending scene that clearly results in justice (the murderer pays for his crime), injustice (the murderer gets away) or irony (the investigator gets his man, but loses someone or something in the process or the investigator does not get his man, but the loss results in a greater good).</p>
<p class="noindent1">So what happens if I fail to deliver even just one of these obligatory scenes from the above list?</p>
<p class="noindent">I haven’t written a mystery novel. I’ve written a book that doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is nothing more infuriating to blue-collar novelist pros than listening to amateurs who obviously haven’t done the work necessary to know their art form. You can’t help but lose respect for them. It’s akin to your cousin Lou who makes “Pot-au-feu” without meat or vegetables calling himself a French chef.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_51" class="calibre4"></a>In order to write a professional novel, you must know the conventions and obligatory scenes of your chosen Genre. (I’ll detail those of the thriller Genre later on when I dive into <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs</em> in <a href="part0014_split_000.html" class="calibre4">part 7</a>.) If you don’t know the conventions and obligatory scenes for your chosen Genre(s), learn them.</p>
<p class="noindent">How do you do that?</p>
<p class="noindent">Read the top novels in the Genre (yes, the most commercially successful ones) and write down what they all have in common. And “literary novels” are of a Genre too… If you are going to write a Testing Plot novel about endurance and tenacity, you better read <em class="calibre7">The Old Man and the Sea</em> and <em class="calibre7">Deliverance</em>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once you know them, how do you go about writing obligatory scenes?</p>
<p class="noindent">Obligatory scenes are the most difficult ones for a writer to crack—<em class="calibre7">the discovery of the dead body scene</em>, <em class="calibre7">the hero at the mercy of the villain scene</em>, <em class="calibre7">the first kiss scene</em>, <em class="calibre7">the attack of the monster scene</em>, etc. The reason is that these scenes can easily devolve into cliché. They’ve been done to death. To come up with something fresh and surprising is an extremely difficult task.</p>
<p class="noindent">A lot of writers have contempt for obligatory scenes for the very reasons I described above. They don’t want to write them because they find them cheesy. A few even insist that their work is so intellectually challenging and above “Genre,” that they are exempt from having to fulfill these expectations. They’ll tell you that their work is more of homage to a Genre, not really part of the Genre, etc. Which is complete bullshit.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the writer’s global Inciting Incident is one associated with a particular Genre and she doesn’t innovatively pay it off in the way that the Genre demands, the book won’t work. People won’t buy it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Other writers (some call them hacks) love Genre because they think they can just recycle old scenes from the Genre’s vault to fulfill these obligations. But if you rehash something you saw on a <em class="calibre7">Mannix</em> episode from the 1970s, you will sorely disappoint your reader. They may not have seen that particular episode, but they will easily be able to tell that what you’ve written is unoriginal. If you’re re-using the setup and payoff of a particular obligatory scene from the past, chances are someone else has too.</p>
<p class="noindent">Remember that the earliest readers in a particular Genre are experts.</p>
<p class="noindent">When I ran mystery programs at the major publishing houses, you can be sure I was aware of the thousands of hardcore crime readers. I couldn’t help but run into them at conventions and specialty bookstores. These readers are desperate <a id="page_52" class="calibre4"></a>for innovation. Their first question is always, “What’s new?” These core two to four thousand readers will give new writers a shot. If the writer creates something unique, the aficionado will buy the next book too. And the book after that if the second one pays off too. This is how careers were made back in the day. Still are, even with the big publishing houses abandoning core Story categories for the big book. There’s a reason why <a href="http://Amazon.com" class="calibre4">Amazon.com</a>’s most successful publishing programs all involve the core Genres.</p>
<p class="noindent">But if the writer is rewarming old Rex Stout plotlines and somehow makes it into a big house without being found out, rest assured these first readers will know. They pride themselves on their expertise and if they find you lacking, they’ll tell their fellow mystery junkies to skip the book. It’s “meh,” not worth their time. They won’t brag about having a first edition of your first novel. They won’t look forward to your next book. They won’t give you another chance.</p>
<p class="noindent">But what about those hugely successful novels that defy what I’m saying? What about those books that don’t deliver fresh obligatory scenes and are still huge bestsellers?</p>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes, an influential group of readers (usually critics) fall in the love with a book or just its prose and talk it up incessantly. The sophisticated and <em class="calibre7">The New York Times</em> reading metropolitan cocktail crowd (a dying tribe if there ever was one in the new connected age of “Weird”) hear the chatter. Wanting to be “in the know,” the swells repeat the hubbub and quite a number of books are bought and displayed on coffee tables across the country. But many if not most go unread.</p>
<p class="noindent">Writing for that kind of attention is not going to fill the hole in your soul. It’s certainly not a business plan. Again, it’s like buying a lottery ticket.</p>
<p class="noindent">Instead write for the Genre nerds desperate for new stories. They won’t desert you when you push the envelope too far, either. Just knowing where the envelope ends will warm their hearts.</p>
