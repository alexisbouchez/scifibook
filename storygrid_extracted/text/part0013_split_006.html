<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith sixty-four rows corresponding to sixty-four scenes in the novel <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs</em> and fourteen columns detailing the step-by-step progression of the global Story along with the key values for each scene labeled and all elements of continuity detailed, we’ve got the micro progression of scenes fully fleshed out. Now is the time to use <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid Spreadsheet</em> to help us analyze the novel from the thirty-thousand-foot view, the macro distillation of the <em class="calibre7">Foolscap Global Story Grid</em>.</p>
<p class="noindent">We’ve now reached:</p>
<h3 class="h2">THE EDITOR<br class="calibre2"/>STAGE FOUR</h3>
<p class="noindent">Deconstructing the big movements of how Thomas Harris created that rarest of novels—the outrageously successful commercial thriller that stands as one of the pre-eminent novels of the twentieth century will be a lot of fun. Seriously. Somehow Harris wrote a book that was impossible to put down but deeply resonates with the reader long after he’s finished reading. I’ve gone through the book at least fifty times line by line and I always discover something new. While I do not profess to have any insight into the working mind of Thomas Harris or of how he crafts his stories, what I can do is analyze the structure of his work within the traditions and conventions of his chosen Genres.</p>
<p class="noindent">We’re going to do this by going back to our <em class="calibre7">Foolscap Global Story Grid</em>. This is the Norm Stahl/Steven Pressfield one piece of paper that outlines an entire novel. So let’s now go macro and fill in the foolscap page for <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs.</em></p>
