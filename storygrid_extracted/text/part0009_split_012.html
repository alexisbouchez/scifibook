<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">PLOT DRIVEN OR CHARACTER DRIVEN?</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat comes first when you set out to tell a Story? The kind of plot you want to tell or the lead character you have in mind? This question is the equivalent of that old debate about whether something is plot driven or character driven. The distinction is meaningless, really, as a character’s actions are what determine the plot and the plot is the sum total of a character’s actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">But what can be helpful when you are in the early stages of crafting a global Story or editing the one you have is to think about what excites your personal imagination. What kind of “What if?” do you like best? Some of us think in terms of external “What ifs?” while others of us think in terms of internal “What ifs?” Figure out which kind of person you are and this will help you immeasurably. Either way works. And finding the most exciting “What if?” will also be the key to creating your Story’s Inciting Incident…the event that throws your protagonist’s life out of balance.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you are an external “What if?” thinker, you are probably a comic book fan, an action fan, a mystery fan, a horror fan or a thriller fan. You fantasize “What ifs?” like “what if a tidal wave hit New York in the middle of a U.N. assembly?”</p>
<p class="noindent">If you are an internal “What if?” thinker, you are probably a coming of age novel, love Story, redemption Story, education Story or family saga kind of fan. You think of “What ifs?” like “what if a woman’s husband leaves her on the same day she finds out she has Stage Four ovarian cancer?” “What if a mother didn’t love her son but refused to acknowledge it?”</p>
<p class="noindent">The first “What if?” is the thinking of someone who wants to write, for lack of a better expression, a plot driven Story. The second example is someone who wants to write, again for lack of a better expression, a character driven Story. One loves big Arch-plot while the other favors minimalism.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_84" class="calibre4"></a>The truth though is that it just doesn’t matter what kind of “What if?” you dream of exploring. The best “plot driven” Stories have compelling protagonists that chase subconscious internal objects of desire while they are also trying to get the President of the United States out of the U.N. before the tidal wave hits. And “character driven” Stories also require compelling quests for conscious external objects of desire, remission from cancer for example, while the lead character struggles with deep subconscious internal objects of desire like the need to attain some kind of meaningfulness before death.</p>
<p class="noindent">STRUCTURE AND CONTENT are intimately related. No matter how you slice it, the Arch-plot and Mini-plot STRUCTURE GENRES require a foundational quest, which in turn requires an external conscious and internal subconscious object of desire. The ways in which the writer reveals those external and internal objects of desire is by making crucial choices.</p>
<p class="noindent">These choices begin and end in the last Genre category, the CONTENT GENRES.</p>
<p class="noindent">I’ve divided CONTENT GENRES into two distinct types.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">1.</span> EXTERNAL CONTENT GENRES define your protagonist(s) external objects of desire.</p>
<p class="number">What they want.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">2.</span> INTERNAL CONTENT GENRES define your protagonist(s) internal objects of desire.</p>
<p class="number">What they need.</p>
