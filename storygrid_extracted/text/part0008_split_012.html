<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">FLASH FORWARD: <em class="calibre10">THE STORY GRID</em> IN ACTION</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">J</span>ust for fun, the next two-page spread is what <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> infographic for the writer looks like for Thomas Harris’ novel <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs.</em></p>
<p class="noindent">Don’t panic. It’s not nearly as complicated as it looks.</p>
<p class="noindent">Like a human being, a Story has global systems from which extremely specific features develop.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em>, at its most fundamental, concerns just six questions that you will ask yourself over and over again. My business partner, Steven Pressfield, has an organizational technique he uses before he starts any novel or narrative nonfiction piece. He calls it <em class="calibre7">The Foolscap Method</em> because the whole thing fits on a single sheet of yellow foolscap paper.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre7">The Foolscap Method</em> is <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> in miniature. It’s a one-page version of <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> and it is the first stop on the way to creating the big matrix that tracks all the pieces of a Story. We’ll go through it in depth in <a href="part0010_split_000.html" class="calibre4">part 3</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <em class="calibre7">The Foolscap Method</em>, we ask ourselves just half a dozen questions of the Story we’re about to write, or have already written…over and over again:</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">1.</span> What’s the Genre?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">2.</span> What are the conventions and obligatory scenes for that Genre?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">3.</span> What’s the point of view?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">4.</span> What are the protagonist’s objects of desire?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">5.</span> What’s the controlling idea/theme?</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">6.</span> What is the Beginning Hook, the Middle Build, and Ending Payoff?</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_39" class="calibre4"></a>Do you think of your Story in these terms? Do you ask yourself these questions? This is how an editor works to make a Story work. This is how they identify problems and how they discover the fixes for them.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="part0013_split_000.html" class="calibre4">part 6</a>, I will use <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid Spreadsheet</em> to break down, scene by scene, Thomas Harris’ masterpiece <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs</em>. But before we get into such post-graduate detail, let’s start with the absolute basics.</p>
