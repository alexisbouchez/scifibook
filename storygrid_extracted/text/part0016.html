<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">A TOOL, NOT A FORMULA!</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne last big thing to remind you.</p>
<p class="noindent">I think I’ve stated numerous times that <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> is a tool. It is not a formula.</p>
<p class="noindent">You cannot just plug a bunch of stuff into The <em class="calibre7">Foolscap Global Story Grid</em> or <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid Spreadsheet</em> and then diagram it out in the final <em class="calibre7">Story Grid</em> and voila have a terrific book come out at the end. If that were the case, I’d do it myself. <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> is a tool, a method to check your work or to inspire a work. Nothing more.</p>
<p class="noindent">I want to leave you with a few other thoughts.</p>
<p class="noindent">It took me twenty-two years to figure out that <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> was not something that any other book editor I knew used. After innumerable lunch and drink dates, I found out that they didn’t create their own method to evaluate work by studying Story structure. And they thought I was kind of a nerd for doing that myself. Acquire it, tweak it, get it to market were their mantras. And sometimes that was mine too. Remember that editors don’t work for writers. They work for publishers.</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that I’m a grizzled vet and I understand the realities of the book publishing Business versus the desires of Art, I see <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> as a tool to bridge the gap between commercial necessity and literary ambition.</p>
<p class="noindent">First things first…commercial necessity. Rest assured, using <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> will absolutely do no harm to your Story. It will not turn a book that works into a book that doesn’t work. It will not botch up your best scene or convince you to cut your best secondary character.</p>
<p class="noindent">Instead <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> can make you learn a great deal about why you’ve written your Story in the first place. And that knowledge will be indispensable to making your work better. Not just a little bit, but to such an extent that you will <a id="page_332" class="calibre4"></a>find yourself re-energized to laser focus on what exactly your Story is and how you can make it the best it can possibly be.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> is all about getting from “Doesn’t Work” to “Works” to “Holy Moly This is Incredible!”</p>
<p class="noindent">Remember, like a joke, if your Story has three major movements—a Beginning Hook, a Middle Build, and an Ending Payoff—for a simple, compelling premise, it works. But that doesn’t mean a publisher will offer you a contract or that one million or even one person will buy it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Now having something work is nice.</p>
<p class="noindent">But we all know that some jokes are good and make us chuckle and some make us spit out our food. Same with Stories. Some are okay. Some change our lives.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want your Story to be great, you’ve got to hone it and edit it yourself. Even if you get a Big Five publisher to take it on…<em class="calibre7">especially if you get a Big Five publisher to take it on</em>. The publisher has bought your Story because they are confident that it will sell to a critical mass of readers “as is.” That’s their job. Whatever editorial commentary they provide after they’ve bought it will be first and foremost all about getting their investment back! So they’re not going to ask you to take another look at your Lovers Kiss scene and make it less cheesy. A lot of people like cheesy…probably more than those who don’t. Only you will care enough to really push yourself to take it from cheesy to heart wrenching.</p>
<p class="noindent">Now, you may wish to have a greater impact in the world than just selling to ten thousand people (hitting that number is a huge success regardless). If that is the case, you need to know how to analyze and improve the work you’ve already done without killing the good stuff. This is what <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> is for. It’s for fixing flaws and bettering strengths.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you write a better Lovers Kiss scene than the solid cheesy one you’ve written before, readers will recognize it. They want that better scene. They really do. And if you give it to them, they’ll come back for more of your work in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you use <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> tool rigorously and do not give in to the “good enoughs,” it will definitely prove the difference between “nice work here, but it’s not quite right for us” to “we’re getting our numbers together to make you an offer.”</p>
<p class="noindent">It’s my contention that most writers don’t fear the work. They want to do the work. No one, though, has clearly laid out in practical terms exactly what that work is. I built <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> methodology to do that.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_333" class="calibre4"></a>Most amateur writers understand the general concepts of Story: that they need a compelling Inciting Incident and that they have to satisfy the expectations of their audience for the particular Genre they’ve chosen to write. But they have no idea where to begin and no idea of how to analyze their work after they’ve done some of it to make sure it can withstand the critical winds and turbulent external forces of nature. The problem that bedevils most novice writers (and even some seasoned pros) is that they fall in love with the glamorous aspects of the literary trade—the romance of “the creative process,” the thrill of dashing off chapter after chapter in a white heat of inspiration, etc.—and they undervalue the blue-collar aspects of Story construction and inspection—understanding and mastering Genre, Story form, character, Story cast, and so forth.</p>
<p class="noindent">They fail to learn how to edit.</p>
<p class="noindent">The inescapable fact is that you need an editor who cares about making your book not just “work” but for it to transcend its Genre…to break new ground in such a way that it changes the way people see the world. And there is only one editor alive with that kind of commitment.</p>
<p class="noindent">You.</p>
