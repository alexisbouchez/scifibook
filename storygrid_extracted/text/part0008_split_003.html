<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">WHERE DID <em class="calibre10">THE STORY GRID</em> COME FROM?</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen I began my editorial career at one of the major New York publishing houses, there was no systematic process to learn how to edit a Story. That is, how to read a Story, diagnose its strengths and vulnerabilities, and then help the creator heighten the highs and eliminate the lows.</p>
<p class="noindent">There was no training program at the publishing houses.</p>
<p class="noindent">There was no course in college or in graduate school.</p>
<p class="noindent">You couldn’t sign up for Editing 101.</p>
<p class="noindent">While there were (and still are) hoity toity finishing schools for recent college grads to matriculate through in order to secure an entry-level position in the field, these summer programs were more attuned to the business side of publishing than to the art.</p>
<p class="noindent">The assumption was (and still is) that the capacity to edit a Story is a mystical combination of intellectual rigor (one must be well-read and well-schooled in comparative literature, the classics etc.) and an intuitive <em class="calibre7">je ne sais quoi</em>, a flawless internal Geiger counter that can magically sort radioactive literary or commercial works out of the inert rubble piles where they are hidden.</p>
<p class="noindent">To learn the editorial craft, one had to apprentice. One would sit in the presence of and serve someone who had the magical editorial hand, and by osmosis, the mentor’s skills would pass on to the neophyte. Like a cobbler or a blacksmith, one learned how to do by watching someone else do it well and then applying the lessons from those observations in one’s own work. Under the tutelage of an expert who would redirect the pupil when he went off course, editors were made. This is the way it has worked for decades, even centuries.</p>
<p class="noindent">But apprenticeship as vocational training is highly dependent upon the “master” role in the relationship. And unfortunately <a id="page_15" class="calibre4"></a>the editing masters of my era, and even more so today, are overwhelmed with the business of book publishing. They just didn’t have an hour a day or an hour a week for that matter to devote to training editorial assistants. Their time was spent finding books that the company could publish successfully, reading submissions and competing with likeminded editors at other publishing houses for the best properties. And when they weren’t hustling acquisitions, they had to attend meeting after meeting and prepare thousands of words of editorial copy to sell the books into the marketplace.</p>
<p class="noindent">So what separated the good editors from the great editors? And how could I find a way to put myself in the latter category?</p>
<p class="noindent">There are amazing editors out there who have a knack for finding the Story that will become the next big thing. And there are extremely charismatic editors who can dazzle sales forces and book reviewers in ways that make their projects reach the widest possible audience. But the ones I admire most are what I would call the “Hail Mary” editors. These are the ones that publishers call in when a project is in deep trouble. These editors can take a book that almost works or is even sometimes a complete disaster and retool it with the author in such a way that it not just works, but oftentimes it reaches frontlist bestsellerdom and then backlist nirvana.</p>
<p class="noindent">Frontlist sales come at the front, those that result from the initial splash of publication, the reviews by the big newspapers, the ad campaigns, the marketing programs etc. Backlist sales are titles that come quietly day after day, month after month and year after year, from word of mouth recommendation, from one reader to another. Backlist classics build publishing houses.</p>
<p class="noindent">Hail Mary editors help create the classics.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is the kind of editor I set out to be.</p>
<p class="noindent">All I had to do was learn how to Edit with a capital <em class="calibre7">E</em>. And then hone my skills to razor sharpness. There was only one problem. There was no book called <em class="calibre7">How to Edit</em>. I’d have to figure it out myself.</p>
<p class="noindent">The result of this decades-long exploration is <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em>. It came out of my life’s work and is my attempt to create that <em class="calibre7">How to Edit</em> book that I needed way back when…</p>
