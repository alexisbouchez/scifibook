<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">WHAT IS <em class="calibre10">THE STORY GRID?</em></strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre7"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Story Grid</em> is a tool I’ve developed as an editor to analyze and provide helpful editorial comments. It’s like a CT scan that takes a photo of the global Story and tells me what is working, what’s not, and what must be done to fix it. When I show <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> to writers, they love it because it allows them to break down the component parts of their novels (or narrative nonfiction) to see where their Storytelling went off track. Identifying the problems in a Story is almost as difficult as the writing of the Story itself (maybe even more difficult).</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> is a tool with many applications:</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">1.</span> It will tell the writer if a Story “works” or “doesn’t work.”</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">2.</span> It pinpoints problems but does not emotionally abuse the writer, revealing exactly where a Story (not the person creating the Story…the Story) has failed.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">3.</span> It will tell the writer the specific work necessary to fix that Story’s problems.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">4.</span> It is a tool to re-envision and resuscitate a seemingly irredeemable pile of paper stuck in an attic drawer.</p>
<p class="number"><span class="num">5.</span> It is a tool that can inspire an original creation.</p>
