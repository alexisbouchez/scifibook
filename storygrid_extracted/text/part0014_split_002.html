<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">FILLING IN <em class="calibre10">THE FOOLSCAP</em></strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or fun, let’s look at the world through Thomas Harris’ eyes and let’s pretend that he uses <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> to help him organize his thoughts. It’s 1982 and he has to make some choices. Again I have no idea how Thomas Harris works nor would I presume to tell him how to work. I’m just looking at the end result and reengineering it through my <em class="calibre7">Story Grid</em> methodology.</p>
<p class="noindent">He’s already written a great serial killer thriller called <em class="calibre7">Red Dragon</em>, which introduced the piece de resistance of serial killers, Hannibal Lecter.</p>
<p class="noindent">What’s he going to do next?</p>
<p class="noindent">Harris is a working pro. That is, he makes his living writing. <em class="calibre7">Red Dragon</em> was successful enough that his agent and his editor probably plead with him to write a sequel. The publisher backs up the notion with a hefty advance. So Harris is tasked with outdoing <em class="calibre7">Red Dragon</em>, the novel that defined the serial killer novel.</p>
<p class="noindent">What a nightmare!</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre7">Congratulations…you’ve done something very few writers have ever done before…now do it one better!</em></p>
<p class="noindent">Harris doesn’t panic. He gets out a legal pad of foolscap paper and writes down what he needs to decide. It will look like this:</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_263" class="calibre4"></a><img src="../images/00021.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_264" class="calibre4"></a>The first question to answer is easy:</p>
<p class="centers"><span class="line">External Genre: <strong class="calibre5">Serial Killer Thriller</strong></span></p>
<p class="noindent">The second question is easy too, as we know the thriller Genre backwards and forwards. The global value at stake in a thriller is a convention—life/death.</p>
<p class="centers"><span class="line">External Value at Stake: <strong class="calibre5">Life to Unconsciousness to Death to Damnation</strong></span></p>
<p class="noindent">Now, why did I write down Life to Unconsciousness to Death to Damnation? I did so to remind myself of the progression of negativity of the LIFE value. It moves from LIFE to UNCONSCIOUSNESS to DEATH. But of course, it goes even further. To the end of the line of human experience.</p>
<p class="noindent">What is that?</p>
<p class="noindent">It is the fate worse than death…DAMNATION.</p>
<p class="noindent">The most compelling thrillers take us to the end of the line…the limit of human experience. Thomas Harris knows that his protagonist for his sequel must move through these stages to reach a fresh and personal hell (just like his protagonist Will Graham did in <em class="calibre7">Red Dragon</em>). His protagonist must face damnation. [Review the chapter THE POWER OF NEGATIVE THINKING in <a href="part0010_split_000.html" class="calibre4">part 3</a> for further explanation on value progressions.]</p>
<p class="noindent">We are just two answers into filling out our Foolscap page and already we know just about everything we’ll need to know about the global structure of the new novel. Just by clearly deciding the global Genre and using the value at stake for that Genre as our North Star.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here’s why.</p>
<p class="noindent">We have to write a BEGINNING HOOK for the novel, then a MIDDLE BUILD, and finally an ENDING PAYOFF. But we can’t just willy-nilly shift our global Story Genre in mid-stream from serial killer thriller to love Story and throw out our global life value and substitute it with a global love value.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_265" class="calibre4"></a>That would be a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p class="noindent">The reason why we can’t do this is because the major turning points in a Story require turns on the global value of the chosen global Genre. That is, the climax of the Beginning Hook, the climax of the Middle Build and the climax of the Ending Payoff must turn on the Life value for a thriller. For a love Story they must turn on the love value.</p>
<p class="noindent">Now smaller scenes in the thriller novel (those we fully detailed in our spreadsheet) can certainly turn on other values. But the big moments have to turn on the global value.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because we know straight off the bat that we’re writing a sequel to a serial killer thriller, we know that we have to abide by the serial killer Genre’s conventions for the major turning points of the Story.</p>
<p class="noindent">Harris knows that those conventions insist that he move the lead protagonist from a stable LIFE at the beginning of the Story to a state of cluelessness, UNCONSCIOUSNESS, at the end of the Beginning Hook of his Story.</p>
<p class="noindent">And then Harris knows that he has to take the protagonist from UNCONSCIOUSNESS at the end of his hook to the threat of DEATH in his Middle Build.</p>
<p class="noindent">And finally he must take his protagonist from the threat of DEATH at the climax of his Middle Build to the threat of DAMNATION to pay off the entire Story.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is his goal…to take his protagonist to the limits of external human experience. Some thrillers, most in fact, don’t go this far and that’s okay. But they have to at least have the threat of damnation if not put it in play. Or they’ve gone to the limits of human experience in the Story’s supporting Internal Genre. Or they simply work without going to the end of the line. They work, but they’d don’t push the envelope of the Genre. If you want to transcend the run of the mill stuff in your chosen Genre, you must take the Story to the end of the line.</p>
<p class="noindent">Harris went for broke with <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs</em>. He chose to take his Story as far as it could go.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because he knows he’s going for broke, Harris moves to the last three quarters of his foolscap page and writes the following in the three blocks designated for his Beginning Hook, Middle Build and Ending Payoff. These notes will remind him of how his scenes must progress.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_266" class="calibre4"></a><img src="../images/00022.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="noindent">On his foolscap, he’s reminding himself that the BEGINNING HOOK of his book will move his protagonist from LIFE to UNCONSCIOUSNESS. Then the MIDDLE BUILD must take the character from UNCONSCIOUSNESS to threat of DEATH. And lastly, the ENDING PAYOFF must deliver the limit of human experience moving from the threat of DEATH to the threat of DAMNATION.</p>
<p class="noindent">So if and when he gets stuck at any place in his novel, Harris will have a concrete reminder of the most important progressions. He’ll have something to use to evaluate his scenes. No matter how great a scene, if it gets in the way of moving his lead character from one life value to the next, it has to go.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_267" class="calibre4"></a>What is so impressive about Harris is that instead of banging out just another book that mirrored the progressions of <em class="calibre7">Red Dragon</em>, he challenged himself to write something completely different. The foolscap he has in hand now is the same as it would have been for <em class="calibre7">Red Dragon</em> at the same stage of construction.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, what Harris chose to do with <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs</em> is to do <em class="calibre7">Red Dragon</em> one better. He added a remarkably satisfying Internal Content Genre for his protagonist. Reading <em class="calibre7">Red Dragon</em> and then <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs</em> back to back is the equivalent of listening to Glenn Gould’s <em class="calibre7">Goldberg Variations</em> recorded in 1955 and then listening to the same pieces recorded in 1981. They are both astounding works, but for my money Harris in 1988 and Gould in 1981 are examples of creators moving from exuberant geniuses to seasoned artists.</p>
