<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">THE KEYS TO INNOVATION</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>enre craft demands innovation. And that innovation is found in the way a writer handles audience expectations…the obligatory scenes and conventions of your chosen Genres.</p>
<p class="noindent">This requirement is exactly the same thing that Steve Jobs and Apple faced when they decided to create a new cell phone. Jobs knew that the iPhone had to be compatible with cellular networks, at least one of them. He knew that it had to “ring.” He knew that the connections between callers had to be clear. And tens of other obligations and conventions (a North/South hearing and speaking convention) had to be met. So the question Jobs asked himself was not, “How do I make something completely unique and change the way people speak to each other?” but, “How do I build on and reinvent those things that phone users demand while also giving them an intoxicating original experience?” Jobs worked inside the phone “Genre,” and then moved the Genre forward.</p>
<p class="noindent">As you’ll remember, the first generation of iPhones had a tendency to disconnect in the middle of calls. The obligatory antenna required in the phone did not deliver. It wasn’t until Apple fixed that problem that the iPhone moved from Apple baseline cult first generation adopters (its Genre experts) to middle managers abandoning their BlackBerrys. The core fanatics cut Apple some slack on the first iteration of the iPhone, but they didn’t evangelize to non-cult members until all of the bugs were out of it.</p>
<p class="noindent">It’s the very same thing for books.</p>
<p class="noindent">Win over the experts and keep banging away at the keyboard. When you’ve knocked out something extraordinary, the experts will beat down their neighbors’ doors to get them to read your book.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_54" class="calibre4"></a>I know one thing is for sure. Apple opened up every single cell phone they could find to see what they all did and how they did it before they started working on the prototype of the iPhone. Shouldn’t writers do the same thing?</p>
<p class="noindent">There’s no shame in not knowing something. The only shame is when you willfully ignore and then blame the educated for your failures.</p>
