<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">WORKS, DOESN’T WORK</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow many times have you read this snippet of a book review, either on <a href="http://Amazon.com" class="calibre4">Amazon.com</a> or in a major newspaper or blog?</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre7">This book is badly in need of an editor.</em></p>
<p class="noindent">It is not without irony that these sorts of reviews are most often attached to titles that have sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Rare is the “<em class="calibre7">where was the editor?”</em> decree for a work of meta-fiction from the writer with an MFA from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop.</p>
<p class="noindent">Why is that?</p>
<p class="noindent">Beyond <em class="calibre7">The Emperor’s New Clothes</em> factor many reviewers succumb to, an Alfred A. Knopf press release or advance praise from last year’s bright young thing is often enough to move a snooze of a book to the top of the superlative review pile. “Literary” works are given a much wider critical berth than the commercially appealing salted peanuts kind of Storytelling. The reason is that there is no comprehensive formal education available for learning the essential fundamentals of Story. Let alone how to take those fundamentals and turn them into clear tasks capable of being objectively (or better still subjectively) evaluated. While reviewers, by the very nature of their critical point of view, profess to have such knowledge, most do not. They just don’t get “works, doesn’t work.”</p>
<p class="noindent">It’s as if a person alien to the qualities of life were presented with a live mongoose and a perfectly preserved taxidermy of a mongoose and asked which one is “better.” The stuffed carcass, while perfectly quaffed and “life-like” is impressive. But given a choice of having to look at a dead mongoose stuck to a plank of cedar and a live mongoose in its natural habitat for four hours, which choice would you make? I’ll take the wild thing over the pretty thing every day of the <a id="page_25" class="calibre4"></a>week. Even if it has only one eye, its hair is matted, and it has an uncontrollable rabidity. Sometimes, especially because it has those immediately recognizable scars and afflictions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Others say, quite volubly, that they would choose to contemplate the stuffed animal. (I think they’re putting on airs no matter what they say…)</p>
<p class="noindent">For me, as long as the thing is alive and I have no idea what it’s going to do next, I’m in.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are plenty of ways to praise or critique a writer’s sentences, or a taxidermist’s fur fluffing for that matter, but few critics are capable of explaining why some novels or histories or narrative nonfictions read like bats out of hell while others put you right to sleep.</p>
<p class="noindent">It’s easier to attack the bestsellers than it is to de-bullshit MFA fiction. And deep down, the “where was the editor” reviews are not really there to shame the bold name writers who know how to spin a wildly intoxicating tale but are not the best sentence to sentence. They are to show off how erudite the reviewer is, be it a <em class="calibre7">Wall Street Journal</em> review or the 1123<sup class="calibre14">rd</sup> amateur review at <a href="http://Amazon.com" class="calibre4">Amazon.com</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The subtext, of course, is that editors aren’t doing their job at the very least and publishers are idiots at the worst. <em class="calibre7">Why don’t they help the poor Story savants out and teach them how to write a proper sentence? If they did, the collective culture wouldn’t be subjected to such pablum</em> is the ad nauseam refrain.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, the reality is that editors <strong class="calibre5">are</strong> doing their jobs. Very well in fact.</p>
<p class="noindent">You just need to remember one primary tenet of business to understand why this is so. People collect pay when they satisfy their employers. Editors at publishing houses don’t work for writers. They work for for-profit corporations. So, you might reasonably ask, if these editors are doing their jobs, how in the world do such books escape the editorial process?</p>
<p class="noindent">How do these cheesy, poorly drawn line-by-line writers escape without being re-written?</p>
<p class="noindent">The answer is that a Story either works or doesn’t work. It either engages the reader or it doesn’t. It’s alive or it’s dead, like our mongooses. And the last thing an editor wants to do is kill a living Story, no matter how mangy.</p>
<p class="noindent">And thus, the oath of the professional editor is like that of the physician, a Hippocratic one.</p>
<p class="noindent">First, do no harm!</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_26" class="calibre4"></a>But there’s a catch. And the catch is the hypocrisy of the business.</p>
<p class="noindent">Working “literarily” and working “commercially” can be two very different things. A Story can take the reader through expertly crafted sentences with innovative metaphors that would be the envy of Proust. Technically, its sentence-by-sentence craftsmanship is beyond reproach. And perhaps many novels are honed to line-by-line perfection through a dynamic relationship between the writer and a word-by-word, sentence-by-sentence editor. But for all of the minutial skill of these novels, the Story may have absolutely no narrative drive.</p>
<p class="noindent">This book may “work” literarily, but in no way does it work as a Story. These books are the equivalent of our perfectly preserved mongooses.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is not to say that these well tended corpses can’t sell a lot of copies and become bestsellers through the forces of the previously mentioned <em class="calibre7">The Emperor’s New Clothes</em> phenomenon…<em class="calibre7">If everyone says it’s great, it must be great even though I can’t get past page nine.</em> And there are some editors who are experts at finding these properties that today’s <em class="calibre7">Emperor’s Court</em> will lavish praise upon and make the work that year’s must read…or that is, must buy. But as there are fewer and fewer trusted arbiters of genius in the media these days (there are only a handful of newspapers that even review books anymore), it’s getting more and more difficult to sell copies of a book based purely on its literary cachet.</p>
<p class="noindent">Mind you, there are writers who take on a project knowing that they are more interested in fluffing fur than caretaking a wild beast. For them, a success is defined almost academically. That is, they know they are experimenting with technique and know that getting the attention of likeminded intellectuals is their preferred goal…not necessarily <em class="calibre7">The New York Times</em> bestseller list. They’re pushing the boundaries of form intentionally and understand when they make that decision they will inherently limit their audience. They’re pros though and thus, they’re cool with it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Knowing exactly what it is you are doing is the key.</p>
<p class="noindent">And making a conscious decision about your project as best fits your goals for that project is crucial to managing your own private expectations. I think it doubtful that James Joyce thought he’d make a killing writing <em class="calibre7">Finnegans Wake</em> or that Samuel Beckett put down a deposit for a beach house while he was writing <em class="calibre7">Waiting for Godot.</em> They knew what they were doing—breaking Story form and taking the chance that the project would die in a desk drawer.</p>
<p class="noindent">You better believe they knew the form, though, before they broke it. Just as Beethoven knew symphonic form before he smashed it with his <em class="calibre7">Ninth Symphony</em>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_27" class="calibre4"></a>Those form breaks were so well constructed that they pushed Story structure’s edges out further.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the other end of the spectrum, a writer’s prose that wouldn’t challenge an eight-year-old’s vocabulary or ability to follow a sentence can be impossible to stop reading. And when one finishes that book, it’s most often disingenuous for the reader to say that he wasn’t satisfied. He may have quibbles, but he read the whole thing to the very last word. That’s a Story that abides Story form but will not end up in the pantheon of Western civilization.</p>
<p class="noindent">So what’s the bottom line here?</p>
<p class="noindent">Learn the form. Master the form. Then if you want to try and write the next <em class="calibre7">Gravity’s Rainbow,</em> knock yourself out.</p>
