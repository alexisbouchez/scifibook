<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">THE OBLIGATORY SCENES AND CONVENTIONS OF <em class="calibre10">THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS</em></strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">S</span>o Thomas Harris has his marching orders in terms of his External and Internal Content Genres. What he’ll do now is write down the obligatory scenes and conventions of the serial killer thriller in shorthand to remind himself of his “must haves.”</p>
<div class="lineses">
<p class="centerfs1">Obligatory Scenes and Conventions: <strong class="calibre5">1. Crime/MacGuffin 2. Villain makes it personal 3. Red Herrings 4. Clock 5. Speech in praise of villain 6. Hero at mercy of villain scene 7. False Ending</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Looking at this list of seven, Harris understands that each of these elements should be literally “on stage, on the page” so that the reader is clearly satisfied that they’ve been delivered. They can’t be off stage and reported by a third party.</p>
<p class="noindent">So, we’ll need at least seven scenes to deliver what is expected in a thriller:</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> A scene/chapter that establishes the central crime and its inherent MacGuffin (the big “want” of the villain)</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> A scene/chapter that establishes that the villain has made his crimes personal in relation to the investigator</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> A scene/chapter that establishes at least one false lead/red herring</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> A possible scene/chapter that clearly establishes a clock</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> A scene/chapter that establishes the gravitas/praises the intelligence and/or power of the villain</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> A scene/chapter that puts the hero at the mercy of the villain</p>
<p class="number"><span class="bull">•</span> A scene/chapter that is a false ending</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_275" class="calibre4"></a>These seven scenes are extremely concrete assignments. They break down an extremely intimidating task into clear, doable bits. While you may end up writing twenty versions of each of these scenes before you find the perfect fit for your Story, understanding what these scenes are and why they need to be in your thriller leapfrogs you into action.</p>
<p class="noindent">Write them down on your one page foolscap so that you never forget their importance. And then make damn sure that you have them in your final manuscript. I’ll show you how to do this when you map out the final <em class="calibre7">Story Grid.</em> I’ll pinpoint exactly where Harris satisfied these conventions…the exact scenes themselves.</p>
