<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">BEGINNING HOOK, MIDDLE BUILD AND ENDING PAYOFF</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter we’ve laid out the global elements of our Story at the top of our <em class="calibre7">Foolscap Global Story Grid,</em> we need to nail down the actual major movements. So you’ll see that the final three quarters of our <em class="calibre7">Foolscap</em> is dedicated to mapping out the Beginning, Middle and End of our Story.</p>
<p class="noindent">Boiling your pile of four hundred pages down to BEGINNING, MIDDLE and END and setting aside all of the other pieces in your Story is the single best advice I could give anyone. Remember, Stories are conceptually simple things…</p>
<p class="noindent">A Storyteller hooks us: <strong class="calibre5"><em class="calibre7">Once upon a time, there were three bad children…on their morning walk one day a wolf captures them and takes them to his lair…</em></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">And then we get a Middle Build that raises the stakes: <strong class="calibre5"><em class="calibre7">the three children are tasked to help the wolf slaughter their kingdom’s only source of food</em></strong><em class="calibre7">…</em><strong class="calibre5"><em class="calibre7">while they “help” the wolf, they make a dastardly plan that only wicked children could devise.</em></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Lastly, we get an Ending Payoff that is both surprising and inevitable: <strong class="calibre5"><em class="calibre7">after the children trick the wolf and lead him to his death, his fur fades away, his snout shortens and he is revealed as their long lost father the King. The King awakens and tells them of the spell he’d been put under by an evil housemaid and of how that spell could only be broken by his children. With the return of their father, the children are no longer bad and the family is restored.</em></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">It’s very useful to remember that the BEGINNING is all about HOOKING your reader…getting them so deeply curious and involved in the Story that there is no way they’ll abandon it until they know how it turns out. The MIDDLE is about BUILDING progressive complications that bring the stress and pressure down so hard on your lead character(s) that they are forced to take huge risks so that they can return to “normal.” The ENDING is the big PAYOFF, when the <a id="page_141" class="calibre4"></a>promises you’ve made from your HOOK get satisfied in completely unique and unexpected ways.</p>
<p class="noindent">STORY distilled is…HOOK, BUILD, PAYOFF. That’s it.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Beginning Hook of our little Story above would be the introduction of three bad children (why are they bad?) who get approached by a wolf on their morning walk. The appearance of the wolf is the Inciting Incident that leads to a crisis… to refuse the wolf could end in death for the three children, to abide the wolf’s request could result in worse for the whole community.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Middle Build would be the wolf and children’s preparations for the slaughter of the kingdom’s animals all the while having the children set up the betrayal of the wolf.</p>
<p class="noindent">The ending paying is the revelation that the wolf was their father under a terrible spell. Once his evil persona has been destroyed through the efforts of his “bad/ disobedient” children, he is restored to his normal self. He’s now capable of providing for his brood, knowing that his children are resourceful. The Ending provides the answer to the Beginning Hook, <em class="calibre7">Why are the children bad?</em> They’ve lost their father and without one, they do not fit in with polite society, which is a very good thing when they meet up with a wolf. And it resolves their true selves. They are not “bad” or they would have abided the wolf’s request, slaughtered the kingdom’s food sources and then lived with the evil wolf. Once their father has returned to his normal self at the end of the Story, the world is restored to order.</p>
<p class="noindent">The more time you invest in your global hook, build and payoff, the better your Story will be. You’ll see that I’ve listed five scenes in each section of our <em class="calibre7">Foolscap Global Story Grid</em>. Now let’s take a look at those crucial constituent parts of the Beginning Hook, Middle Build and Ending Payoff.</p>
