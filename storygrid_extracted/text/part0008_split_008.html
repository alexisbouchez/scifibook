<h2 class="chap-title"><strong class="calibre8">YOUR OWN WORST ENEMY</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap1">A</span> few years ago, a very talented line-by-line writer came to me for help.</p>
<p class="noindent">A publisher I respected had recommended her to me. The publisher believed (rightfully) that the woman had what it took to write bestselling thrillers. The publisher had passed on a number of her books…not because he didn’t find them compelling, but because ultimately they “didn’t work.”</p>
<p class="noindent">The writer asked me to work with her from first idea to final draft. That is, she wanted to start from scratch…seek my opinion about the right kind of character to feature, the particular Genre of thriller that I felt was the most underserved and to basically engineer a new novel from start to finish using <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em>.</p>
<p class="noindent">She could not afford to pay my usual editorial fee, but I too believed in her, so we came to a profit sharing relationship. We would be business partners, just like a couple of scientists figuring out how to create a new kind of light bulb. I’d done this sort of thing before with narrative nonfiction as well as fiction, and while the work required a multiple year commitment, I’ve never regretted taking it on. I always learn something new.</p>
<p class="noindent">We got to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">I walked her through <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em>, how I work, etc. and she was over the moon. It turned out that she was as much of a Story nerd as I was. She had read and studied many of the same Story experts I had as I developed my editorial method, so we spoke the same language. She immediately understood my principles and jumped right into the process.</p>
<p class="noindent">We began by both agreeing that she’d write a contemporary thriller that would introduce a brand new series character, a woman with a Jason Bourne-like ignorance of her past. While the External Genre was “spy thriller,” the Internal Genre of the book would be a “disillusionment plot.” (More <a id="page_29" class="calibre4"></a>on this later.) Coincidentally, she told me she had a draft of a book she’d written with a similar character in her closet.</p>
<p class="noindent">She suggested that we begin with that draft to see if there was anything salvageable from it.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is when I started to get nervous. But I relented. Maybe the manuscript could give us some direction…never say never, right? Why reinvent something that works?</p>
<p class="noindent">I read the book and it had some really great moments. Innovative turns of phrase, some seriously frightening scenes. Overall, it gave me even more confidence in her abilities. But it most certainly did not work. It never paid off the promise of the hook in an inevitable, yet surprising way. She did not disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent">I ran it through <em class="calibre7">The Story Grid</em> and then we sat down to go through the places where it went off the rails. Weeks later, I thought we had a very clear understanding that the new lead character for our reverse engineering project would not be based on the character from her previous, unsold novel. Rather we’d use a few of the scenes from the novel that really worked and perhaps adapt them to suit as major turning points for the new novel. I left her with a working map of about sixty scenes/chapters that included all of the conventions and obligatory scenes of the spy thriller form (more on this later). I thought the conventions and obligatory scenes that we’d sketched out were uniquely twisted and innovative to a degree that would delight a thriller fan.</p>
<p class="noindent">I even cold pitched the Story, like Hollywood screenwriters do, to a few friends who held very high editorial positions at Big Five publishing houses. These friends had purchased millions of dollars’ worth of stories from me before, so I knew they had zero interest in humoring me. They wanted me to give them the first crack at the book for their publishing houses, so they were happy to give me quick notes and/or tell me what worked and didn’t work. This is what happens at agent/editor lunches sometimes and it’s the only reason I still have them.</p>
<p class="noindent">I finished my job as a sort of “co-creator/editor/agent” and now it was time for my business partner to do hers.</p>
<p class="noindent">We shook hands and she walked away with the road map to complete the novel. Keep in mind that it took us a good nine months to get to this point. We debated scene after scene until we both felt it was the best solution we could come up with at the time. Were they turning correctly? Were we mixing up the positive and negative resolutions enough? Did we progressively complicate the Story effectively? Did we pay off the hook?</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_30" class="calibre4"></a>We both recognized there would be a very great chance that what we anticipated to work would need to be completely re-thought after we had a draft in hand. But as a reference guide to write a workable thriller, it was spot on.</p>
<p class="noindent">She came back six months later with a book far closer to the original manuscript she pulled out of her closet than I thought possible. While scenes were changed, the very problems that made it unworkable a year and a quarter before riddled the narrative. And an obligatory scene—the hero at the mercy of the villain scene, crucial to nail in a thriller—was gone entirely.</p>
<p class="noindent">I took a deep breath and went through her draft scene by scene again and confronted her about the lack of the crucial obligatory scene.</p>
<p class="noindent">“Well, I wrote it, but then I didn’t like it, so I cut it,” she said.</p>
<p class="noindent">I explained that it was fine to do the scene differently, but without it, the book wouldn’t work.</p>
<p class="noindent">“That’s not true, I read THE LATEST THRILLER BESTSELLER BY A BESTSELLING AUTHOR and he didn’t have that scene…why do I have to?”</p>
<p class="noindent">So that was when I knew this project would never come to fruition. I now knew the reason why this very talented writer kept getting to the one-yard line and was never able to score a touchdown—a working thriller. Instead of dedicating herself to nailing the form of the thriller/Story, she decided she was above it. She wanted the fruits of the labor (bestsellerdom) more than the labor itself (writing a brilliant and innovative hero at the mercy of the villain scene no matter if the book was ever published or not). She wanted to be a bestselling thriller writer so badly, she decided doing what BESTSELLING THRILLER WRITERS did was more important than abiding by centuries-old Story form.</p>
<p class="noindent">In her mind, conventions and obligatory scenes were all well and good, but because a BESTSELLING THRILLER WRITER was able to ignore one or two in his novel and still become a bestseller, she felt she must do that too. No matter how hard I tried to explain that she couldn’t copy what a BESTSELLING THRILLER WRITER did and get the same result, she refused to change her mind. Over and over again, I told her there was no Formula, just Form.</p>
<p class="noindent">Her argument of course was that if a BESTSELLING THRILLER WRITER was able to break the conventions of the form, she should be able to as well.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here’s a difficult concept to grasp and I’m sure I’ll go to my grave trying to explain it. Just because a book becomes a bestseller doesn’t make it something to emulate. There are a myriad of reasons why some books become bestsellers and still don’t <a id="page_31" class="calibre4"></a>work as Stories (See <em class="calibre7">The Emperor’s New Clothes</em> phenomenon). Sometimes, there’s just a hunger for a particular kind of book (Vampires, Zombies, BDSM novels) based on some ephemeral need in humanity’s collective subconscious that drives sales. Trying to write one of those books that get swept up in the tide or even, the ultimate for some, a book seen as the cause of the tide, is folly. It’s like selling your house and putting all of your money on number seven at the roulette table because you have a feeling number seven is going to hit!</p>
<p class="noindent">Chasing the vagaries of the bestseller list (believing in formula and not form) is the mark of the amateur. That’s putting the by-product of the Story (money, fame, etc.) ahead of the Story itself. Your contempt for form and lust for formula may even give you what you want. You write the next huge thing that makes you hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="noindent">Now what? That kind of writing is equivalent to winning a lottery.</p>
<p class="noindent">Why not just play the lottery?</p>
<p class="noindent">The truth is I don’t think my business partner really had contempt for Story form. I think it scared her. She had the stuff to write a terrific Story that played off of century-old themes, but to do so required adherence to fundamentals. Not formulaic rules. Despite all of their desire to live by their own lone wolf ways, ironically what amateur writers really want is a recipe. And certainty. And guarantees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Form scares the big bestselling writers too. That’s why they often write books that do not abide by the obligatory scenes and conventions of their Genres. But just because they have a wide audience that will buy whatever they write does not mean they wrote a Story that worked.</p>
<p class="noindent">In their desire to be unique and powerful, creative people become their own worst enemies. To abide by “rules” seems antithetical to why we’re artists in the first place. So when presented with things that look like rules (form) we subconsciously rebel. We resist it with everything we have. And even when we talk ourselves off of the “I’m not going to write that scene because it’s stupid” cliff, it’s really hard to actually see the form for what it really is—an opportunity. Form gives you the place to throw down your best stuff.</p>
<p class="noindent">Take the Hero at the Mercy of the Villain scene. It’s been done to death. Try not picturing Bruce Willis or Liam Neeson chained to a pipe and being tortured when you hear “hero at the mercy of the villain.” How do you keep from writing that setup, but instead, innovate it and still deliver the form?</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_32" class="calibre4"></a>Thomas Harris did it in <em class="calibre7">The Silence of the Lambs</em>. He didn’t run away from it. Instead, he probably wrote two hundred versions of it and none of them worked. He probably didn’t really figure it out until his tenth draft. What’s important to remember is that he didn’t quit until his thriller WORKED. And working means abiding by conventions and obligatory scenes of Genres.</p>
<p class="noindent">The writer/business partner and I never did get on the same page about her thriller and we parted ways. Unfortunately, it’s five years later and she still hasn’t been able to get a publisher to take her on. I think about her every day and have faith that she will one day set aside her Resistance to form and create something remarkable.</p>
